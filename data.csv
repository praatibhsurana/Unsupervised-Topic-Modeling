Contacted to change date as original date was changed by [REDACTED]
Dropped the car off at the time stated on the order and 30 mins later ready to drive away simple great job.
I knew about the superb service because I have bought tyres before from [REDACTED].
Efficient and good value
"Good choice, easy to use, great pricing"
This is the best price and range of tyres I could find also local garages and good times
because it was hassle free. booked it online. took it to the garage on a Saturday and collected after. it was cheaper than the garage I took the car to.
I have used [REDACTED] on a number of occasions and have always received great service and a really good quality product. The number and locations of the approved fitting centres makes it easy to fit in with work.

Affordable and good online tyre data info. The only negative comment is I wanted to book at home service but could not book a slot except am or pm
Nice and Easy. The website nice and simple to use. A local garage fitted them at a time of my choosing. No issues or problems with the service.
"Why the wait. Purchasing the new tyre and booking an appointment for fitting was very straightforward, but I was rather disappointed that having made a booking I still had to wait around for nearly 2 hours at the garage when the actual fitting only took 20 mins tops."
"Thought I’d already done this but it’s definitely worth doing again as I’m very satisfied with [REDACTED] and the authorised fitting firm Shawfix. Very good system,efficient and great value for money. I highly recommend this company and I’m glad a friend of mine recommended them to me too."
Easy to use and faultless from start to finish
Everything done as expected. However either this fitter (ATS) or my local garage where I had a service done has put some finger marks on the inner roof lining. but I can't be sure which.
Tyres purchase and fitting. Tyres fitted to my car locally at a great price.Kept informed of fitting date and time throughout.All in all a fuss free and pleasurable experience which I will definitely use again.

New Tyres. Quick delivery to fitting centre that was also quick and very efficient. will def. use [REDACTED] and the garage again.
"Very professional and helpful staff.Strongly recommend although I had slightly problems with one of the garage's date after I selected the convenient garage with their availability date and hour to fit four tyres for my car.15 minutes later I received an email from [REDACTED], saying that the nominated garage is fully booked on that day ( when I booked there were showing other three different times as well on that day !! ).The garages's deta bases have to be up to date with [REDACTED] system. Many thanks to [REDACTED] staff were resolved the problem very quickly."
"Will use again. Ease of ordering on line, choice of garage, good price and pleased with service all round."
"Excellent service. Price is great (fitting included in price, no hidden costs). Fast and great service, will always recommend."
"Easy to use and garage was great. Only crticism is that on [REDACTED] it said the slot was morning so I checked with them what that actualy meant. They said I could go anytime from 8.30 to 11.30. I booked the fitting and got an appointment time of 8.30, no flexibility as per first enquiry. I mentioned this to the garage and they told me they also get told what time slot it is by [REDACTED]. This should be clearer up front."
"Seamless hasslefree experience. Seamless delivery, fitting and payment. Good price too. I like being able to select the tyre I want in advance. There was a good range to suit my budget and being able to schedule it for a time/day that suits me is very handy."
Very easy to use and a great saving on previous quotes. Faultless from start to finish
"Never had any issues with the tyres, fitting or garages i’ve Used via [REDACTED]- easy and cost effective service."
"The whole process is very slick, prices competitive, and the ratings of nearby fitters helpful to choose who to use. I have used [REDACTED] for a number of years now and never been let down."
Got high end tyres for an awesome price. Definitely use again.
"Friendly service and advice,very good prices through [REDACTED]"
Great service and a nice easy way to choose tyres for your budget
"No problem ordering online, quick and easy process, good choice of booking slots and pit stop convenient to get to. Took guys longer than expected to change my tyres but could see that they were tired and had a very long and busy day. They were friendly and just nice guys. Thanks for doing the job and will definitely use them again. Cathy"
"This company wont leave you deflated. Really easy peasy way to buy decent reasonably priced tyres with the ability to pick a fitting time,|(if required) that suits your needs. Used them now for the last four or five years and never had a problem."
"Reliable. Fast, reliable and with excellent prices."
"What a great service. The [REDACTED] website offered me a great price and the tyres were delivered to my local fitter promptly - as promised! The fitter at M D Tyre & Exhaust Centre, Gorse Lane Industrial Estate, Clacton was friendly and thorough. I would be quite happy to recommend this service!"
"Was quite happy to book with them, but the reason i only gave an average review my appointment was changed twice and i had other arrangements in place which i had to change"
Quick easy courteous fair value
Good choice of tyres at a competitive price. This is the second time I have used them and both times I have been very happy with the service.
"Tyres ok, but balance on wheels was set very wrong by garage. I Gone abroad and had to stop In Germany to set balance again because it was not possible to drive."
"Great service, great price and able to book a garage on line at a time that suits"
Excellent. Easy to navigate web page clear pricing structure . 5 stars
Got 4 tyres £150 cheaper and was fitted at my local ats same week would recommend them to anyone
Tyres fitted at ats couldn’t fault them only issue is ats could have done same price and not moaned at having to fit tyres for [REDACTED] stating they didn’t like [REDACTED] Other downside is [REDACTED] don’t offer tyre insurance but ats would have if I bought them from ats insurance at £9 per tyre. I don’t think I’d use [REDACTED] again or recommend them
"Great price, no fuss"
"Good value, easy to order and a good local garage to fit the tyre."
Very easy to order and quick to deliver
Tyres delivered quickly and excellent time slot for me. Tyres delivered quickly and excellent time for fitting provided for me. The actual fitting took a bit longer than expected. Apparently this was due to one of the new tyres not inflating on the rim. The fitter stated this was because the tyres are stored badly and when delivered they are slightly mis shapen and won’t fit on the rim properly. He did get there in the end after many attempts. Pleased with the tyres and no other problems encountered.
Thank you again Excellent service. Value for money. Exceptional service. Easy to navigate website. What more do you need? Thanks again [REDACTED].
Good prices easy to organise. Buying on line easy with a good range of local fitters - chose a garage we know well and everything was done as expected with no hassles

"Good tyres, at a good price"
Great service at a great price.
"Great as usual. We've purchased from [REDACTED] several times, this time from a completely different garage. They were really good, the tyre fitter was nice and very friendly, job was well done.I can't recommend them enough and going through [REDACTED] meant cheaper too."
Great Service. Not quite the cheapest this time but service at Protyre Weston-super-Mare excellent.
Good prices and good choice of fitting near me used many times before and will do in the future.

"Great service. Came to my work, on time, and so quick. Can’t fault them..will def use again."
The ordering and booking process was straight forward. However the fitting of the tyres was delayed so had to hang around for over 45mins longer than expected. Something beyond [REDACTED] influence.
Easy to use and by far the cheapest around. Great communication
Good service and was able to have them fitted by a local garage all arranged through [REDACTED].Will use them again.
Best Quality Tyres and Cheapest Prices I Could Find On The Internet!!! Will Definitely Use Again!!!
Excellent service. Prompt and efficient replacement of 4 tyres at home at an agreed time on a Saturday morning.
"Great price, easy to use website with the ability to use local garage for fitting. First time i have used [REDACTED] and will definately use them again"
Tyres and fitting. Tyres ordered into my local ATS - cannot fault the service or price.
"Excellent pricing, at a garage I have used and trusted before."
Great price and service - highly recommended
"Very Good Service Great Prices. I had my Tyres fitted at McKinnons in Wellington, Surrey. The service was quick efficient and the fitter was a good communicative type of chap! All in all very pleased with the price and fitment of the tyres."
Nice idea but double check garage has equipment. It turned out that The garage selected didn’t have the equipment required to change the tyres. My husband ended up losing a day taking the car to a 2nd garage. There is now a clunking sound under the car - so will have to take it to a third garage to get this looked at.
Easy to use website. Local friendly fitting station quality product at the right price
Consistently good. Blackheath Tyres coped very well on a busy morning and the quality tyres were fitted expertly. Its the same every time I use [REDACTED].
Excellent service. Reliable product at a realistic price!
Simple and easy to use. Tyres were cheaper than other places I looked and tyre fitting was very simple with lots of garages to pick from. All with date and times to suit everyone.

Great service fantastic price very pleased always use [REDACTED] for my tyres
"Good Service and value. Good value and even when I made a mistake they recognised it and contacted me and sorted it all out. Great service also from McConnachies in Sighthill, Edinburgh who fitted the tyres."
"Home fitted Avon tyres. We had our Avon tyres fitted at home to our new Ford Ecosport. Very easy to order, the only thing I had to do was manually select the tyre size because the auto pick list against our licence chose a 16 inch rim, well the wrong tyre really. Always best to check the numbers located on the wall of your tyre and you will be fine.Anyway second time Chris has been and fitted tyres for us, great service, quality, price and you don't even have to leave home. Tyres have made a big improvement to the cars noise levels, better braking and cornering in all weather. Thanks Chris and [REDACTED]."
Very easy to order. Good communication. Excellent price. Delivered on time. Would use again.
Quality. Great price and Great service
"Everything done online, good value for money. Tyres seem to be good, but only time will tell if they are really good value."
"Very happy with the whole process. Good selection and price, the garage were quick and efficient."
Easy to use website. Saved me over £100 on 2 tyres. Simple decision.
"Quick and easy site to use, all the information was readily available no digging for small print ratings etc. I chose mobile fitment, they met in a convenient carpark near my work and changed my tyres there and then in 20 minutes."
"Easy website, great prices, choice of fitting dates and good communication"
Good value for money
Near perfect combination of competitive prices coupled with excellent service from fitters.

Good choice in tyres and good prices
I chose 9 because the garage did a good job 1 point of for the garage owner being a bit off maybe because I was 10 mins late
Very easy process and good prices
Local. Good prices. Friendly service.
"Good prices, easy to organise"
Great service at my local garage and great price from [REDACTED]
Locally fitted tyres and great backup when needed
Never used [REDACTED] before. The range of tyres were great at a really good price. I also had them fitted at a [REDACTED] tyre fitting place who were very quick and efficient.
Very good service although my appoint was for 15:00 hours I didn’t get my vehicle into the workshop till 15:20
"Price as good Facilities were good Timing was good Failure to torque up the front wheels before inviting me to drive off - not so good. An unease as I drove down the road turned into fear I would loose both wheels before I could get back to the fitters. The offer of £5 for my inconvenience was good. The failure to use the locking nut adapter properly, thereby destroying it and leaving me with no way to remove and replace wheels - not so good. Ordering me a new adapter was good I still haven’t seen it yet a week later - not so good."
Cos the garage bm enterprises is excellent very professional and lovely people
"Good prices, easy to use website and lots of garages to choose from for fitting."
Website easy to use . Quick and convenient fitting arrangements with tyres fitted on drive by courteous technician in double quick time.
Easy. Quick. Good prices. Local fitters.
because it would have been cheaper to use ATS direct
"Easy to access, good price, good service"
"The Web site is easy to use, excellent service in respect of delivery of tyres, fitting and price reasonable for premium tyres."
Price and tyre options and the ability to have them fitted locally and reliably
"Good range and prices, easy to use"
"I've used [REDACTED] previously several times for tyre purchase and fitting for three of my cars and each time the service has worked seamlessly and very efficiently. On a previous occasion, I needed to contact their CS dept. and was rapidly and properly served by a helpful, professional and friendly UK agent. Lots of companies could potentially sell tyres only online but [REDACTED].com also have the UK national fitting service options fully covered. So each time, as now, I purchased tyres from [REDACTED].com and ordered a fitting service from ATS Euromaster at our branch in Knutsford (incidentally those friendly guys there, Mark & Andy, are always excellent and bang on time). The fact that [REDACTED].com deliver exactly the tyre you order online to your chosen fitting depot and it's always there for when you arrive for the fitting is great. In short, it all works without any fuss or issue. Plus importantly, the [REDACTED] prices have always been the most competitive (online or offline); with or without the fitting element. So they tick every box, imho. Did I miss anything?! [REDACTED].com and ATS Euromaster - individually and collectively brilliant!!"
good prices - good service - good fitters
T.he site was very easy to use and a good choice of garages to use in my area
Great service and good price for tyres
Easy to use website and choice of garages.
Price was reasonable. Selection was mostly easy. Convenient to have everything delivered and fitted nearby
"This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED]. The process of choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me. The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms. The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know. Prices are slightly cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell. My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent. I will be using the service next time I require tyre services. Takes the worry out of searching, buying and arranging fittings!"
"Was very easy to navigate site, pick tyres from the ratings and organize fitting locally."

"quick service, best price in uk, only one year old tyres, thank you"
The Guys at ATS were friendly and efficient all done in very good time. They also advised me of fact that my exhaust was loose
Excellent value for money
"5 For [REDACTED]. Firstly [REDACTED] gave me a good choice of tyres & prices to choose from. Ordering tyres & booking fitting was very easy. One of the reasons I chose [REDACTED], is that they offer Saturday fitting so it doesn't affect my working week. Got to fitters, which was only 15-20 minutes away, showed my order & they got started on it within 10-15 minutes. The staff at the garage were very friendly, listened to my instructions regarding which tyres needed changing & changed them quickly & efficiently. Overall a very good experience which made getting new tyres for my car straight forward & convenient."
Fabulous service from [REDACTED] straight forward and super fast service from ATS I would recommend it no hassle and no waiting around
I was kept waiting for for some time after the original appointment. OK otherwise.
I give continental five stars good tyres for my Nissan Qashqai 2017 plate
Satisfaction. From the start to the end professional excellent service and very reasonable pricesThe garage done a very excellent jobThank you gays
No complaints. The price was competitive and the service was extremely smooth.
"Does what it says on the tin. Good prices, easy to use website and local garages"
Easy service and good price
Good service as always cheap tyres always buy from them.
Quick service at a great price.Booking the fitting in to suit my shifts was a massive help as well.
"I received the service I expected that I had prepaid forI ordered on line, selected a fitting centre and appointment time then turned up and had the new tyres fitted that I had paid forI waited in the reception area and 30 - 40 minutes later I was on my way again Job doneThat's what I expectedSo I can't really add any more than thatNothing to complain about and nothing to be over exited about"
"Easy process but problems with booking a fitting appointment. The website made it easy to find the correct tyre specifications for my vehicle, and to place the order. I was offered a number of fitting options and chose ATS tyres, then selected a time slot to suit my convenience. Unfortunately the time slot I selected was not available at ATS and I had to wait a further two days for a convenient time, at which point the tyres were fitted quickly and professionally. Would have given five stars apart from being offered a fitting time that they couldn't honour."
Autowise at Bexhill were very good - no complaintsMy only issue was the original planned date had to be changed as the tyres were not available to be at Autowise for the original date
"Great price, great service and fitted via local ATS - magic!"
Excellent service and price
Was so easy to find the tyres to fit my vehicle. There was a garage within less than a mile from me. They were very efficient and so helpful. Have used [REDACTED] a few times now. Never had a problem. Would recommend them every time.
very good deal all fitted no fuss will be back for more tyres soon.best deal going cant fault them
"Provides a good service. This is third time I have used [REDACTED], which proves they are doing a great job. I found the tyres I was looking for at a competitive price and the tyres were delivered to the fitter ready to go on the date and time I selected. I also like that you can compare tyres on the website so can make an informed choice."
"Easy way to fit new tyres. Good experience from ordering to the fitting,no hiccups,just good old job done no quibbles ,i have used before might not be the cheapest but the fitting partners win it for me 1.2 miles from home."
I would definitely recommend [REDACTED] as you can choose the tyres and the price that are suitable for you. Also you can choose a local garage which [REDACTED] use to have the tyres fitted. I received an excellent service.
Good price and timely convenient fitting. I needed an urgent replacement for a badly damaged tyre and [REDACTED] came through as they have in the past at a good price with convenient fitting.
It took 3 bloody hours to fit just 4 new tyreswithout wheel alignmentwasted my day and rude staff at the garagethey havent got any idea about cars and tyres. I would not recommend it for anyone else!!!
Quick and efficient and very good value home service at just £6 extra.
This is the second time I’ve used [REDACTED] and the service was excellent. All my future tyre purchases will be made through them. They are unbeatable on quality and value.
Yeah nice job. Reasonabke price and everything was ready when I arrived a Handforth Dean tesco. Professional staff all good.
"Competitive Excellent customer service. The site is incredibly easy to use and the choice of tyres and fitting locations is impressive. Can't complain about the prices. Where this company really impressed me was with the customer service. When it came to rearranging my fitting appointment and location all of the work was done on their end and they left me a nice voicemail and email to confirm the booking. There was no need for security questions and all of the usual nonsense. It was a straightforward human interaction, and it resulted in a streamlined experience, and a happy customer."
Brilliant...from original enquiry to the fitting of the tyres.Would definitely recommend!!!!!
"[REDACTED].Your appointment system is not fit for purpose!I booked Wed AM but you offered Thurs PM as the earliest appointment. You also stated that I should arrive early as the garage operates a first come first served. WRONG! They operate an appointment system. Mine was for 15.30hrs which you were informed of but failed to pass on. A reoccurring problem I am led to believe. The garage were excellent and revised their schedule to fit me in earlier. Still a 3hr wait.Your quotes for tracking and alignment were totally inaccurate.The only positive to come out of this debacle, on the day your tyre price was the cheapest I could find."
Date and venue changed with less than 24 hours notice. The garage ‘couldn’t fit me in’ then when I asked if I could collect the tyre from there and take it to another authorised fitting centre I was told the tyre wasn’t there. How were they going to fit it if it wasn’t there in the first place?
"Great choice, easy to order,fitted on time, perfect."
"Easy quick service. Cheaper than most places and arranged for fitment at a local garage on my day off work. Garage was friendly and helped swap wheels around as well as carried out extra work at the same time (wheel alignment, at extra cost).Will definitely use again."
Great service at designated fitters. Tyres already there when I arrived.
Decent price based on discount offerGreat mobile fitterWould use again
Excellent experience. Great tyres at a great price. Arranged to have them fitted by a garage just 3 miles from home. All fitted in under 30 minutes.Would highly recommend [REDACTED].
Helpful and fast service. The guys there were helpful and knowledgeable. My service was fast and efficient. Will definitely be returning and would recommend 👍🏼
"Made a mistake with the tyres I ordered and the guy(Derek,silverburn) in the fitting station couldn't be more helpful in getting them changed for me.always use [REDACTED] anyway but now recommend them to all my friends."
Excellent from ordering to selected garage first class
"I have regularly used [REDACTED] for buying tyres, this purely because they have great prices in comparison to the dealerships or tyre shops. The service is straight forward and the selected tyre shop (which I use) provides excellent service."
Superb service and a quality’s product. Locally done and quick appointment. Very impressed. 😀
Very pleased with the ordering process and the local garage that fitted the tyres.
"Good price, easy to buy, great partner garage."
"straight forward and easy to understand,great discount on the price"
"An easy way to save money. I have saved a lot of money over the years buying tyres from [REDACTED] - but it is not just about the money, the service we have received from them and their approved fitters has been excellent. I would heartily recommend them."
Excellent straightforward service. Clear sense of pride in workmanship. I wish - it was easier to find. The workshop is tucked away in a corner of an industrial estate.
good service 1010. good service and the cost was excellent. 10/10 i certainly will use [REDACTED] again. thanks.
Great service and good price.
Best decision Ive ever made. Ordering the tyres you need online and getting them delivered and fitted at a garage near you is the icing on the cake.
"Great price and brilliant service!! Tyres fitted at my place of work, fitter sent text message advising arrival time and tyres fitted quick. Will definitely use again!"
Great availability and prices. The exact tyres (not a common specification) I was looking for were in stock for next day delivery to my local tyre fitment centre at a great price.
Blow out less than 10 days later. Great service fitting but we had a blow out on one tyre less than 10 days later in the alps and got mugged having to buy a new pair in Chatel so not happy!!
"very price competitive. Elected tyre installer had very good service, too."
"Good value for money. Very good value tyres for my car. The [REDACTED] operator was very helpful in shuffling my appointment round with the garage. The garage, Bathwick Tyres in Brislington, Bristol, were excellent as well. Very patient when I had problems with my locking wheel nut and persevered with sorting my tracking/alignment out until it was sorted. Highly recommended."
"Excellent service, terrific price I couldn't beat it. smooth professional service at the tyre fitter Woodfords Garage Burnham on Crouch."
"This is the second time that I have purchased Tyers from [REDACTED] and find them very competitive on price, plus they give me confidence in the quality of the Tyers fitted. I can’t fault the tyre company that fitted them ATS Shrewsbury."
"Highly recommend. Easy to book, fab prices and great customer service. Will definitely be using next time."
"Good price, on time delivery, no hassle."
Great price and tyres fitted on time by ATS
"Best prices, a brilliant tech at Lakeside branch, Dylan I think was his name, did a fantastic job replacing all 4 tyres and balanced perfectly all in under 30 mins!I will never use another tyre supplier while you guys deliver such great service and prices!!!!A VERY happy customer!!!!!!!!!"
Chap and Speedy. Friendly service and transparent pricing.
"Good selection of tyres at very competitive prices. Easy to book a fitting slot, Very helpful staff at ATS Abergavenny. Very happy with the whole experience"
Very good tyres great price great garage..
Fuss free. Ordered the unusual tyre size for my classic in moments. Delivered & fitted in days. I took off & fitted myself by choice. Slightly more expensive than buying just the tyres & then the hassle of finding somewhere to fit them. Great thanks.
Tyre late by over 6 hours. After making an appointment for 9.30am the tyre wasn't ready until past 4pm. This is unacceptable .
Great prices and options of fitting
Great booking system but garage was poor tyres still covered with the white stuff they use to fit them. Looked a mess.
Quick and easy to order tyres . We turned up at designated garage and changed tyres with no hassle.
"Would use again. Easy to navigate and orderGarage I picked was spot on, tyres were sorted in no time"
"Good all in price, choice of garages, a time to suit you."
"Great service. As always, fantastic service from [REDACTED]. Great price and fitting was smooth."
"Easy to order online, good price and good fitting service."
"Great Service Good Pricing. No problems regarding ordering, delivery and fitting of tyre.ATS gave excellent friendly service with explanation of need for tyre.Highly recommended.I"
We got fantastic service from [REDACTED]. Had all 4 tires changes at my home for a very reasonable price. Could not ask for better service.
first class efficienct service on time as booked
"Great choice, reliable, great prices"
good price as ever andfitting centre. Good price as ever and fitting centre was great. I've used [REDACTED] for about last 10 years and always found the service great.
"Good tyres at a good price. No silly hidden charges at the end like some other online tyre providers.Fitter was prompt, and very good. Did all 4 tyres in approx 30 mins on site."
excellent prices service and garage i went to were quick and very courteous.
Fast delivery....excellent prices
"Tyres chosen, garage chosen for fitting, time slot chosen, payment made and order confirmed. Fitting time changed and communicated to me however when arriving at the garage there was no booking made. I waited 30mins for the ATS team to fit me in but they then said they couldn't fit me in and I ended up returning the following day."
"test review, should be deleted"
Excellent service and great prices
It was easy to chose the best prices and compare tyres. Easy to do everything online and get it all booked in. Would highly recommend.
"Rubbish not the usual service. The tyres were two days late, and Black didn’t do much to help. This meant I would need to go to an alternative fitting station and it was suggested that I pick them up in my car (and take them to the alternate fitting station). I contacted the original fitting station who were very helpful and agreed to fit the tyres for me. Fitting station 10/10 👍😀[REDACTED]. 0/10👎🏻 😡 Finally I had no follow up from [REDACTED] to explain/apologise for the rubbish “service”.........."
"Easy, straightforward and competitively priced. Welcombe garage fitted the tyres- friendly staff and very efficient. Highly recommend, will be using again."
Quick and easy ordering and fitting was hassle free
The website was great. Had the tyres I wanted at a good price and the options for fitting were great. However. I opted for the. Mobile tyre fitter and I chose a fitting in the pm 3 days from when I ordered. Granted I did order on a weekend but I was told I could get my tyres. I then got a phone call 5 minutes before 12pm to tell me the tyres would not be fitted that day as they didn't get to the fitter in time.. I had arranged a half day off work to do this. Not best pleased as the customer service agent didn't seem to bothered to have told me this news and it was OK for tomorrow. Just as well my work is flexible enough.
"This was an easy and helpful experience to order in advance the exact brand and quality of tyres, rather than just take what is available. An appointment of my choosing at a convenient location and a quick and efficient job. Would definitely choose [REDACTED] again."
Great service all round even able to change the appointment with no fuss
After having my order confirmed and booked with supplier I was later informed that neither the order of 4 continental tyres could go ahead and that the booking had to be rearranged.
"Very easy site to use, great choice of tyres. The Avon ZX7s I chose were great value, plus I could choose a fitter less than 100 yards from where I work. Very happy."
"Convenient, easy and no trouble. Very happy with [REDACTED]. The local garage it was delivered to was below standard but this was not [REDACTED] issue"
"it would have been 10 ,if there had been a proper fitting slot rather than an am first come first served"
"Good prices, nice hassle free purchase and no faffing around getting them fitted, just turn up at the appointed time and they do them there and then, I was in and out in no time."
"Fitting superb but need more realistic appointment dates. Booking experience was a little disappointing. Was offered appointments on the website from Thursday, so chose the following Friday morning. [REDACTED] came back to say the garage couldn't carry out the work then, and offered Saturday morning instead, which wasn't convenient. To save time, I rang and spoke to a very helpful lady who organised it for first thing on the following Wednesday.The fitting experience was superb. I arrived, handed over the keys, and just under an hour later, the job was completed and the keys were returned.I spoke with the receptionist about the fitting dates. She told me that the delay was due to [REDACTED] not being able to supply the tyres in time for the first date I chose.Perhaps [REDACTED] should offer more realistic appointment dates to allow enough time for the tyres to arrive at the fitting location."
Website was easy and quick to use. Tyre specs listed along with grades for efficiency and fuel consumption along with noise of the tyre. A mobile tyre fitting option was also available which was perfect for my situation.
"A BENCH MARK OF SERVICE AND FITTING TO BEAT ALL OTHERS. A great experience from a respected seller. Customer service was also of a high standard. I was kept up to date with the fitting arrangements and although there was a delay on my requested fitting date, CS handled the issue with total professionalism and courtesy. Actual fitting of the tyres were done straight away at the local Troy branch. [REDACTED] is a definite 5 stars for tyre fitting and price. A guaranteed high quality service. RECOMMENDED 100% and THANK YOU!"
"Great service and price from [REDACTED] let down by fitters. [REDACTED] price was by far the best I could find. While they delivered my tyres on time, their fitting garage had suffered an equipment failure and had to delay the fitting by three days. This is the only reason for me dropping my rating to four stars."
borough 4 tyres and took the rims down the day before as for a classic car and they were fitted that day and rang me at 18.45 to inform me the wheels were ready before the appointment time the next morning Brillant
There was a bit of confusion between BC and the fitting garage.
Great clear pricing and good choice of availability
"First time ive bought tyres on line. Usually i look for deals usually on budget tyres too then go to the garage & your kind of at the mercy of whats there. I decided to give this a go & go for proper branded tyres & i have to say now theyre on the car it was worth paying that bit extra it drives & handles brilliantly, i had 4. Having done it now ill always do it this way. [REDACTED] is really easy to use & you can see lots of different makes of tyres & most importantly reviews & ratings on each tyre. Once you've chosen what & how many you want it gives you fitting locations & time slots (fitting included in the price) so you choose your most convenient location & time for fitting. The tyres get delivered to your chosen location, you rock up at the allotted time, they get fitted, job done. Great price too. Ill definitely use [REDACTED] again & can thoroughly recommend them."
First time using [REDACTED]. Website was quick and easy to use. Plenty of tyre choice with specs of each listed along with noise of the tyre. Fitting options were good and prices also very competitive. Mobile tyre fitting option also available which is what I used. Only downside was I had to wait 5 days for them to be fitted.
"Good service gone bad. I’ve used [REDACTED] a number of times without incident before, the last time however was plagued with cancelled appointments for a variety of administrative and logistics errors. This was then followed by the vendor damaging one of my wheels and not even mentioning it to me..."
Tyres were fine ATS were awfully slow. Tyres were fine. ATS took ages to fit and missed the booked time slot by 4 hours. Rubbish slow service.
"Great. Keen and Clear Prices. Good range of product options. Convenient, easy access at a place and time of my choice. I will reccomend."
The apparent attention to detail and careful fitting done at the pit stop.
"Website is very easy to use, products available are very varied, and I returned to a tried and trusted brand. Tyres were delivered to the fitting garage and the job was completed satisfactorily. This was followed by a four wheel alignment, at a reasonable price, and my new tyres make the car so much safer and more comfortable to drive.Many thanks to the guys at McConechy's in Inverness!!"
"When i first trued to book i was given a morning slot. I asked [REDACTED] what that meant and they said i could turn up anytine from 8.30 too 11.30. When i booked it i was given an 8.30am appointment. When i asked the garage why this was, they told me that you tell them the appointment time so the actual window of choice didnt exist."
"Easy to use, great selection, competitive pricing, good service from garage also"
Fast and friendly staff
Brilliant serviceWould highly recommend
"Great service, reasonable prices, fast delivery and fitting date,,,"
Great price - excellent service
"Great value, really easy to arrange and very happy."
"Fantastic, easy, painless service. And amazing value for money!"
Really excellent customer service when fitting a tyre recently. Fitters very professional and friendly. Well done!
Good service and customer care.
Excellent service and support afterwards. Highly Recommended
Very helpful when I need to change my order... additional tyres and a change of date... but I would have preferred to have made the changes online rather than by phone (I was on hold for a looong time).
"Apart from not being able to deliver for the day I requested, they had them there for the next day and contacted to tell me and apologise for the inconvenience. Other than this everything was OK!"
Very poor customer service
"I am a happy customer yet again with [REDACTED]. I'm able to get the exact quality tyres I want and know, fitted at the place I trust. Would be five stars except the website still lists the wrong tyre size for my SEAT so have to know this and manually select the right size. Last time around this was only noticed by the fitter immediately the tyres arrived, to their credit, and [REDACTED] were excellent correcting that order... but not yet their fitment database."
Good customer service. I was informed about minor détails that I was not aware of.
Fantastic customer service
"Excellent Customer service, friendly staff, gets everything sorted."
"You were very easy to book on line, your customer service team were very friendly and helpful when I had a problem and they sorted this out straight away."
"All staff I encountered (both phone and I person) very friendly, patient and helpful... I choose the wrong tyres for my car which I feel could have been picked up on before I ordered and saved myself (and fitters) the hassle and expense of re-booking... service very good, but something at order point ONLINE to emphasise selecting correct tyres would be very useful and save a lot of time wasting and embarrassment... Not everyone is a tyre expert and need more guidance."
5 Star for [REDACTED]. From start to finish everything went perfectly and was effortless.Put Reg in.Picked tyres i wanted.Picked fitting centergot confirmation email and reciepton day got reminder.went to fitting center 40mins early expecting to wait at least 30minsHIQ just fitted them there and then in 20mins and did a great jobWill get all my tyres from here from now on and use same fitting center
"Good choice of tyres available at a good price. Easy to use website. Good choice of local garages and the one I chose, ATS Euromaster, was quick and efficient. Will use again."
Buying tyres with [REDACTED] was so easy simple steps to find your tyre simple steps to pick your garage and time slot every thing was so so easy will definetly use again and the price was superb
"Great price, fast delivery, loved the inclusive fitting."
Good price and easy local arrangement for fitting
"Great service, great prices & great fitter!"
Bad experience this time. Garage didnt balance wheels properly. Took car back and they rebalanced- car was even worse. I drove 500 miles to Scotland with a wobbly steering wheel. A [REDACTED] dealer in Scotland has hopefully sorted it today. I complained and to date no one at [REDACTED] has resolved my complaint after a chase up email sent yesterday. Poor service. However this is the first time I’ve had an issue like this hence I’ve awarded a 5 not a 0 which frankly is all you deserve on this showing !!
"Alignment problems. [REDACTED] delivery to installation partner was fine, so far as I know, but two weeks later I am still waiting for their repair of alignment machinery so that alignment can be carried out at the time of tyre fitment, which I view as basic. [REDACTED] should monitor these capabilities more closely and help fitment partners to resolve them."
The layout of the website allowed me to choose which tyres I wanted easily. Also what appeared to be good value
This must be the 4th time I have used [REDACTED] and every time they have been great.Tyres arrived and fitted at the date and time I selected
Excellent Tyres Big Discounts. • Easy navigation of website • Great discounts on well known tyres• A wide range of tyres and sizes to match any vehicle • A choice to have them delivered to you or a garage fitted or not fitted• Quick response of date and time when booking into a local garage • Easy payment method
My wheel was damaged by the fitter and you won't take responsibility for it after saying you would
"Initial appointment delayed due to courier losing one of my tyres, rescheduled appointment was not suitable for me as I required my car for that time to travel over 100 miles, which I explained in my email, I was emailed back saying it was the earliest appointment I could get. This resulted in me then phoning during my working hours, to be told I could get my appointment changed to the following day after my initial one, which was more suitable. I was also told the missing tyre would be tracked to make sure it was delivered the following day. Lunchtime the following day my appointment was changed again but to the day after I required my car for! This again resulted in me having to make another phone call and to be told my second tyre was not yet delivered but should be at the site that afternoon. I managed to get the third appointment which was confirmed the day before back, explaining that I needed at least one of the tyres changed. I dropped off my car the following morning at around 7.45 am to be told the second tyre had not yet arrived. My appointment was not until 2.00 pm, but one of the reasons I dropped it off earlier was to ensure the message about needing at least one of them to be done had been relayed appropriately from your company. I was told this was done however was struggling to believe that after being told 2 days before that my tyre would be tracked to ensure it was delivered in the following day. The overall experience was quite stressful. I have used this site before in 2018 and had no issues on that occasion. If this had been my first time using the site I would not be recommending the site at all!"
"The garage ruined the paint on 2 of my alloys, after 5 emails to [REDACTED] customer service still nothing done!."
Efficient and fast service. Only issue was the tyre pressure sensor was not calibrated and the pressure loss sign came on hr after!! It really should have been done once the new tyre was fitted and before I left the bay.
"good price. easy to order. finance available and when I went to have the tyres fitted, it was a smooth experience. Really good"
"As for the garage it is useless, but [REDACTED] tyres are excellent great product great price."
New tyre flat after 1 day. 3 calls to customer service and 5 days later still can’t get someone organised to come back out to get it resealed.
Two front tyres fitted by Taylor’s.I very professional and friendly company
Great prices & simple applications.
"The whole process of ordering,paying fortyres and getting them fitted locally was very easy and efficient."
Efficient and easy to book. The fitting took no time at all and the employee was very friendly!
"Good service, helpful staff and easy to arrange."
good service and prices fair
Very competitive prices and a garage of your choice near by and time to help
Good accurate service and tyres seem good so far
Very happy with the price I was quoted Happy with ATS Treforest for their good service
Great service and great prices
Great service great price and just very good company
Always had good service and the best prices.
Broad choice of tyres in the size required at a competitive price in each price band. Good communication re: purchase and fitting arrangements. Choice of local tyre fitters.
Easy to order you can use a garage of choice. Absolutely hassle free and competitive prices!
Good prices. Excellent choice of tyres and convenient local fitting.
excellent price and service
I found the tyres I wanted at the right price to be fitted by my favourite tyre fitters even. When there was a problem in delivery they let me now well in advance with an alternative booking slot asap after the delivery to the fitters.
"Booked time slots not available. Have been using [REDACTED] for nearly ten years now, during the past year I have booked a few fittings with my local centres only to be told that my appointment time selected from the available time slots on the website were no longer available. Email apologies have been made along the lines of “we are working hard to make sure these problems don’t happen again in the future” A more robust system for communication between [REDACTED] and the fitting centres is clearly needed."
Easy to purchase the tyres. Able to choose a day and time and the garage fitted the tyres immediately on my arrival.
"Wasted time. Travelled 12 miles to have my tyres fitted, waited in the queue for 45minutes to be told only 1 tyre had been delivered, I had to make another journey to have them fitted,,,not happy!!"
Garage fitting didn’t set tyre pressures correctly also didn’t reset pressure monitor on computer
Tyres were good as was price.. but was told there was a problem with my wheels which I am questioning..
"Fast efficient, value for money and the.staff explained in detail what had been done and we also checked the job afterwards"
"Highly satisfied. Apart from the great price on my tyres they came through when the fitting centre badly damaged my wheels(5 wheels by the way)not only did we get a full refund,they are paying to repair all 5 wheels.very happy with the customer service at [REDACTED]."
"3 wheels on my wagon. Had an email the night before my tires should have been fitted, saying they weren't ready. Turns out only 3 of the 4 had been delivered. Simple error, but meant I had to go out of my way. Excellent service from the garage tho. Just a little tip, always contact the garage directly as they are usually more accomodating for times."
"Excellent service, completed by two very professional, courteous gentleman. Extremely easy ordering service, great value for the tyres I chose and fitting was outstanding. Super service which I would recommend to anyone."
Friendly staff and on time as per appointment.
Simple and easy. Quick and easy to find what tyres that were in my price range. I needed four tyres and made an appointment with garage of my choosing. Waited for a comfirmation email about my appointment which wasn’t long. Turned up at the garage and gave the advisor my printed receipt. Felt weird making payment in advance but it was nice and relaxing way to do it.
Great tyres for the best price. Local fitting was faultless and done in less than an hour. You can even have them fitted at your place.Always use [REDACTED] and would recommend others to do so.
"MICHELIN RUNFLATS BEST PRICES. VERY GOOD DISCOUNTED PRICES FOR MICHELIN TYRES. USED VERY GOOD LOCAL FITTER, WHICH I HAVE USED BEFORE THROUGH [REDACTED]. NO COMPLAINTS. NO PROBLEM"
I picked up that the weight on the inside of the wheel was loose and another customer was served and tyre sorted while he was doing mine.
"Great job. Dropped car off, it was ready in an hour, good job, great price"
"I found using [REDACTED] tyres very easy and considerably cheaper than any other tyre company.Also when I went to get my tyres fitted, I had selected the wrong tyres when I contacted [REDACTED] they returned the tyres and helped me select news correct ones and arranged a fitting date and time, brilliant."
Sent me a tyre for a van and not a car
"There was a problem with the time of the booking. The garage claimed 9am had been booked, [REDACTED] had said it would be 11"
It is so easy to purchase and get them fitted. You order them in from your home and turn up and they are waiting at the garage to be fitted 😁😁😁
"Easy, cheap"
"reasonably priced ,good choice of fitting garages. speedy delivery."
Reasonable prices
"Easy booking, appointment changed handled without an issue, all work as organised."
Web site did not pick up my registration for about 2 days. Not a lot of time to book the tyres before holidays and had long drive to airport so had to take images of existing tyres to reference to make booking. Logged on next day and registration was re entered and was recognised. Booking made and tyres changed with 1 day to spare.
Great value for money and the work can be done at a local garage at a convenient time and date.
Great experience buying my tyres online and having them fitted at my local dealer cheaper than the garage could offer for less the price
"Brilliant service, easy to use website and fantastic price"
great price and great service will definatly use them again
"Good price, selected the best grip/fuel efficient/noise combination.Local garage very good - used them many times before. Happy to do the [REDACTED] job - no issues"
Tyres were delivered on time but issues with a tyre missing that’s taken over a week to resolve. Good comms though
So easy to use. Self explanatory. Better prices then I found online. Easy to book. Good garages.
Great selection of tyres and good prices
"Even when I made a mistake, they sorted out my order easily with no delay."
"I used [REDACTED].com for the first time recently to replace 4 tyres. The website was easy to use and they offered the best price for the particular tyres I wanted. They arrange delivery to a local garage (in this case an ATS Euromaster) and it's straightforward to book a date for the fitting. You do pay in advance, but by doing so I knew what I was paying. The partner garage provided a great service too. Overall, a good experience getting my tyres via [REDACTED].com."
"Excellent and flexible service both online and at our local centre in High Wycombe. Highly recommended, and will definitely return in future."
Great service and great price.
"All round good experience. Website made the tyre choice easy, good price, tyres arrived at fitters on time and the fitters (ATS) were helpful and efficient. Would definitely use them again."
First class service for a warranty claim against an apparent defective tyre. Quickly progressed and great service from the tyre repair agent. All in all very and will continue to use [REDACTED] for all future tyres.
"Great service even though tyres were late highly recommend. The tyres were not available at the allotted time for a fit that had been arranged. [REDACTED] contacted me immediately they found out that they could not deliver on time and arranged an alternative date for me! Terrific stuff. My tyres were fitted by ATS in Langney in Eastbourne, the centre is due to move shortly so the building was a tad neglected but the customer service was great.Cannot complain or gripe about anything, great price and great service"
"Easy to get the best price for the particular tyre I wanted. No issues with delivery to my chosen tyre fitter, just great all round service"
"Perfect. Excellent service , they were delivered and fitted on the morning as specified and done in time for my car to pass MOT .... Excellent"
"Ordered and paid on line. Chose where to have tyres fitted, booked a convenient time, had tyres fitted. Excellent service. Very reasonably priced tyres."
Easy order. Easy timing. Good tyre. Great price. Great fitters.
Approved garage damaged my car. Left me financially out of pocket to resolve the issue
Excellent service and value for money.
Ticked all the boxes. Good price Fitted locally at a convenient timeSays it all
"Went smoothly, would use again. Only thing was one email gave different time than requested but final text gave correct time"
Tyres were ready to be fitted whilst the car was motd. No hassle and a great price
Really simple to use. Great choice of tyres from budget to top branded type. Easy to book into local garage.
"The two tyres were fitted efficiently and I was unable to attend at the time of the appointment so they fitted me in when I was able to attend. The staff were friendly, generous with their coffee and were able to fit the two tyres on the wheels of my choice. I’m very satisfied!"
New tyers. Easy booking process and timed appointment was kept and work carried out to agreed price.
"Great option for tyres, best price aswell. Option for mobile fitting very convenient and only £5-6"
Excellent service. Easy straightforward website. Brilliant customer service
Great as always. Great service with a great value end product providing what is expected. Superb as always with a very informative and user friendly guide to obtaining replacement tyres. Keep up the good work
Great quick service. The garage in bath where they were replaced should definitely be given a 5 star award for the way that they replaced the tyres and swapped the wheels around for me. Would highly recommend them.
Easy and cheap.
"It was so easy , from ordering to arranging fitting a kind of one stop shop even getting to pick a time slot for fitting absolutely brilliant. Also extremely good prices"
"I used [REDACTED] for the first time and found them to be a very reliable company who supplied me with good tyres, fitted, at a good price. It couldn't have been easier."
"I bought 4 tyres with fitting in one of the garages which [REDACTED] offer. Short story: the appointment in the garage was book wrong time. The [REDACTED] told me my appointment is at 11.45 when I came to the garage they told me my appointment was at 9.30 instead. I lost a lot of time, took off from work etc."

"Excellent price, superb service. Chose to have tyres fitted at home, fitters confirmed booking, then called to see if an earlier appointment could suit as tyres arrived early, polite, professional and not at all pushy."
"Another great value and easy purchase from [REDACTED], there is always a great choice of premium tyres at competitive prices and factor in the convenient fitting arrangements and you have a real winner. I will certainly use them again."
Very efficient and good value for money
Best deals I could find for 4 Bridgestone tyres
"Quick and easy service to find correct tyre, compare prices and order with good choice of locations for fittinh"
Exceptional service - will definitely use this company again. Very efficient and a lovely guy who happily worked in the pouring rain to get the job done quickly.

Christian Cars in Woldingham did a great job fitting the new tyres and [REDACTED] are always competitive on price.
Good value and easy website to use
Great service and prices
As promised and fitter was good
"Purchasing process was easy. There were no other hidden costs and the partner garage that fitted the tyres were excellent. Overall, a great all round experience!"
Really easy to arrange.. Very happy with the service.
"Tyres are good affordable prices and have a good option of makes and grades,along with a vast assortment of local garage fitters"
The delivery of the tyres was slow and the garage wasn't particularly friwndly
Simple quick and value for money
price and easy access to the tyre depot.
"Great experience, great value tyres and my local garage couldn't have been nicer or more helpful."
"Tyres great, price good, tyre fitting at Just Tyres Leamington Spa was also excellent but the tyres failed to arrive for agreed fitting date and I wasted time on the fitting day and also had to rearrange the fitting twice."
Excellent Service. My son has recommended [REDACTED] as he had used them before and was very happy with their service. I wasn't sure as I've never bought tyres off the internet but I must say what a fantastic price and service. I got the tyres I wanted around £60 to £80 cheaper and got them fitted in 2 days. I will definetly use them again and would highly recommend them to anyone. Give them a go you'll save £s.
Great prices and service. No problem when I needed to change the size of the tyres after I placed the order. Finally a company that listens and delivers.
Great value tyres. Big savings against high street with the option to get fitted at a garage to suit you.
[REDACTED]. The price and tyres were good I wouldn't use the garage again
"Brilliant - welcome, service and customer service"
Amazingly convenient and the best price I could find
Brilliant [REDACTED]. Great price tyres.Good experience just like last time.Would highly recommend.
Good service and very prompt - no long queues- car was ready and waiting when they said it would be.Could do with maybe supplying an umberella for the walk across to the cafe at m&s at handforth dean - as they have the car so could easily get wet on the walk there and back 😀Guys we're pleasant and efficient and had no issues with them at all.
This is not the first time I have used [REDACTED] for buying car tyres.As on previous occasions the tyres have delivered on time and tyres fitted by on of their authorized fitters without any issues.
"I ordered by accident the wrong size tyres - too big. [REDACTED] changed them free of charge, and actually refunded me the difference. Great service."
Tyres were so squashed the garage had to blow them up for one hour before be able to fit them causing a big delay
Value for money... tick... however the delivery by the garage versus expectation... our survey says... eeh eeh.. (Family fortunes sound!!) Not good at all. Turned up asap for the first come first served your site instructed for the AM fitting and was told it was booked for midday and I eventually was allowed to pick up at 2.30pm...
Quality Service. Cheaper tyresEasy to organise fittingGreat website.
Tyres were not delivery to the chosen garage on the agreed date and time .
"Tyres at a good price, choice of garages for fitting and at a convenient time."
Good price and late opening times
Disappointed. This is the first time that I have had problems with [REDACTED] having used them several times before. I arrived at the garage at the time specified only to be told that my tyres hadn’t arrived. The garage was very helpful and chased the tyres up for me. I also called and [REDACTED] and was told that the tyres were out for delivery but they had no idea when they would arrive. They arrived late in the day and the garage where good enough to squeeze me in the same day. Not [REDACTED] usual very good service.
Garage did not appear to know I was due to have tyres fitted.They asked for a couple of hours so I left my car. Went back 2.5 hours later still not done and was asked to wait another 30 mins. I wanted 4 new tyres as I had kerbed 3 of my wheels which are to be repaired on 29th August so had new tyres fitted before repairs as getting tyres fitted usually caused damage to wheels..well they damaged my only undamaged wheel so now I am getting all 4 repaired an extra cost of £130.
"The tyres aren’t great, and it took an hour and a half to fit 2 tyres.It seems they had the new guy doing it, and ‘compressor issues’.Will probably use [REDACTED] again, but not the garage."
"First class!From entering the reception everything was excellent, i left the key with them and returned 30 minutes later to find everything complete.The wheel nut returned to the original storage location."
Service and internet good used before and would use again. Only disappointment tyres rated same as last lot but fuel economy nit as good on this set
"Good prices, easy purchase and fitter service was fast and friendly. Totally hassle free."
Prices are good but not the absolute best. Service and booking is great though!
"Chose incorrect tyre, replacements organised with no fuss. Good prices too..."
"Great options price and service. Great options, prices and service. Fitted by great local garage whilst having service performed. Couldn't have been easier."
i've used [REDACTED] a number of times . Always competitive prices and tyres that are recently manufactured not old stock . Fitting is easily arranged and so far well done ( I always use Alpha and Yapps in Cardiff )
On time and professional service - will defiantly use again!
Quality choice. I purchased the quality choice through [REDACTED]. I was a bit wary as they were un branded but have been pleasantly surprised. They look great and so far have given great grip in both dry and extremely wet conditions.The fitting service at my local centre was also brilliant.
Sped & efficiency by the fitters.
First time customer saved over £30 on two front tyres and service is great customer service very good will use again and and again
Have dealt with them previously. Still great services and good prices.Recommended fitting ATS which is local and that was fine too.
Good description of product.Speedy service and good local fitting.
"Quick, efficient, professional, friendly, well priced. Happy customer."
"Easy fit. Prompt service from garage. No waiting other than the time taken to put on the tyres. The garage completed an inspection of the other wheels and reported no problems. In terms of [REDACTED], the tyres were received by the garage in good time and are of a good quality and price."
"fast, efficient, top brands, rational prices, convenient fitting, all boxes ticked"
"I should have learned my lesson the first time but I have now had a second poor experience with [REDACTED]. This time having placed my order 2 weeks in advance and before my touring holiday, I received a text the day before the scheduled fitting to say the tyres would not be available and asking me to rebook for the following week. This I did (now one day before my holiday). My wife took the car to the garage at 0930 on the rescheduled date to be told the tyres still weren't available. After many conversations with customer service, identical tyres were sourced and fitted at 1630. No-one seems to know what happened to the original pair. Frankly this was hassle I could well do without at my age. On the plus side the compensation was a 2 for 1 deal and the numerous the staff I spoke to were polite and very helpful. However...."
"extremely easy website, lots to pick from, very quick delivery and all in great service"
"Cheapest all inclusive price, choice of local fitters, all round great experience"
Brilliant price and fitted at my local garage as well totally happy.
"Fast service, cheapest price. No worries"
"great price, very easy to purchase and choose fitting garage"
"Great product/price, v easy to use (although a morning appointment does apparently stretch until 1pm if using the mobile service!)"
Brilliant customer service.
Good service and prices
Tyre not at garage when you said it would be even though you had sent me multiple messages about my fitting. You then sent me another fitting time the same day after fitting company had rang me to tell me the tyre would not be with them till the following Monday. Very disappointed in the service this time. Have bought from you before and received much better service.
Decent prices but I was given a fitting time of 9am and when I arrived at the garage I was told this is just a drop off time and it could be up one and half hours to get my car back (two tyres to fit)
No hassle well priced driveway fitting was brilliant
Prices to supply and fit were really competitive and extremely easy to organise fitting at local tyre fitters – I have already recommended [REDACTED] to a neighbour
Dealing with [REDACTED] was easy and cheaper than I found locally. Even though I mucked it up initially and had to 'phone them to change to the correct tyres they were helpful and friendly. The local fitters that I used - F1 Tyrese in Slough - were also friendly and honest and did not try to get extra money for 'other services' as has happened at other tyre fitters.
Easy to select the right tyres and get them delivered to the garage of my choice for fitting at a time that suited me
Great tyres at a great price. Excellent service from [REDACTED] partner McConachies in Falkirk. I turned up early and the guys got straight on with the job. Could not fault the service in any way.
Cannot fault [REDACTED] but the garage I had my tyres fitted tried to rip me off. LAWS TYRES Bridge of Don. Read their Google reviews before having your tyres fitted here.
"excellent service. Competitive prices, good website, excellent customer service via phone to sort out my initial incorrect order!, mobile tyre fitting option was a massive benefit at no additional cost (fitter arrived at stated timeslot and replaced 2 tyres in under 1 hour)"
"On time and efficient, good service."
"Excellent price for a top quality brand tyre and the selected fitter was exceptional in fitting and advising me of forthcoming issues and solving my valve problems. Hats off to the Apsley branch of ATS Euromaster, they went above and beyond my expectations. 5* Thank you all. Brilliant job."
I ordered my tyres they got delivered and also got fitted - however when I arrived for my appointment I got asked who booked the car in by the manager I believe he told me they had advised [REDACTED] to cancel appointments as they were short staffed and double booked. I then said I would leave my car and comeback in a hour - when arrived back a hour later my card had not moved eventually my car went into the workshop about 10.45 I had a hospital appointment at 12.00 I checked on the progress of my tyres being fitted at 11.15 and found the wheels still hadn’t been removed. At that point I left the garage as I needed to be at my hospital appointment. I then had to make arrangements to get to the hospital and also to get back to collect my car I arrived back and my car was done. I understand this is not something you have any control over however the garages you use should be audited as I was not the only customer who wasn’t happy on that day- I also understand how garages work as I worked as a service manager in a main for 25 years I am not disappointed in the service received from you however very dissatisfied with your agents you choose to use .
Good Deals. Very competitive prices meaning better deals.Easy to order and book a time slot at a local garage.Customer service team very helpful as I booked my slot at my local garage but the garage itself had double booked. [REDACTED] ammended this imediately and were very appologetic even though it wasn't their fault.I would use again and reccomend
So easy on line. Tyres arrived late so had to rearrange but no problem.
"No hassle, great prices."
[REDACTED] was good I wouldn't use the garage recommended again
Good price and fitted quickly
Good quality tyres and service at a decent price
"Excellent way to buy new tyres, great choice and great prices."
Good prices
"Why go to anyone else. Easy to purchase on an excellent website and the price is virtually always lower than anyone else, they've also got great fitting options near me, so why go to anyone else?"
"Straight forward; right from choosing, purchasing through to booking fitting. Spot on"
"Good tyres, good price, fast fitting - all good."
The best price I could find on line and was able to select a local garage to get the tyres fitted- excellent
"Easy to use website. Good selection of cheap tyres. Selected, paid and installed locally. No issues what so ever, the way it should be. Thank you so much"
Branded Tyres at a Good Price. Online process is easy and the fitting done by a local garage.Price was the best I could find for the Avon tyres I wanted.
Got tyres supplied and fitted with no problem. Saved 70pound. Excellent service.
"Great service and tyres were competitively priced, with fitting at work to suit my schedule. Would definitely use again."
"The tyres in the end are excellent, but fitting them involved two visits as [REDACTED] sent the garage the wrong size tyres, due to mis-labeling. Then had to wait on the phone for a long time to report the issue."
The service from start to finish the was exemplary
"There was limiited communication from the customer service. After I picked a time to have my tires fitted, I was not informed that the Tire shop canceled this order as the scheduled time had already been filled. I had to call the Tire shop to confirm and [REDACTED] customer service barely responded in a timely manner. Next time, I will just go to a Tyre shop and schedule through them."
"The Tyres were unavailable after purchase. The Tyres were noted as unavailable after purchase and delayed by 5 days. The fitting at Hayes, Thankerton was however great. [REDACTED] Issues were with customer service which was slow and commutation was split over 3 people. Additional compensation delayed due to administration error."
[REDACTED] are very good. I have used them 3 time now and had no problems. Very good service and fitting
"Unlikely to use again. Ordered 2 tyres, got informed Wed 3pm the day before the fitting appointment at 9.30a.m on the Thurs that the tyres wouldn't be available for fitting until Sat. Given that I was taking the car on holiday on the Fri, I was left to find somewhere else at very short notice to get the tyres I wanted fitted in time. Would have given 1 star, but the customer service guy (who I eventually got through to) was really nice and helpful under the circumstances, and sorted out the refund quickly."
"The service is easy to use, you can book a fitting time to suit you, prices are competitive and knowing the fitting garage is reputable helps confidence hence the best of both worlds. The garage staff I used were helpful and efficient. Thank you."
Excellent experience. Good price particularly given the additional discount using their own centre. Very efficient service. On time appointment. Friendly professional staff. Would definitely use them again.
No hassle tyre ordering and fitting at a local garage service which I would recommend
Much cheaper than price quoted from another provider. Quick and professional fitting
Satisfied customer. Used previously and will definitely use [REDACTED].com again. No issues. Tyres at the garage for my appointment.
"Excellent Service. Easy, and good well fitted. No issues can’t fault."
Excellent price and service.
Excellent price
Great service at a local garage
Good price. Fitting easily arranged and with no problems
"This was the first time I have purchased tyres online, the experience was extremely easy with a wide choice of tyres and at very competitive prices along with a good choice of local partners to have your tyres fitted, I will definitely use [REDACTED].com again."
Decent price but had to travel to get the tyres I wanted quick enough
"Second time I’ve use [REDACTED] Taurus tyres and still very pleased with the whole service received from ordering, pricing to fitting went like clockwork. Would recommend"
"Very easy fitting. Smooth, easy experience at a garage you trust, and the tyres cost less than from the big nationals. Whats not to like."
"Good price and easy online booking let down by careless fitting centre. Good price and easy online booking system with tyres available when they say they will be. [REDACTED] let down however by poor quality service from the chosen garage/fitting centre. No apparent follow up from [REDACTED] to check the quality of the fitting centre. Although I would use [REDACTED] again I will never use that particular tyre fitting centre again, namely Howard Selby of North Berwick. This is the second occasion that they have given shoddy service."
Brilliant. Excellent customer service. Great price and great quality
The website was so easy to use and I used ATS to fit the tyers they where very good so no problem
cheap and easy.
3 times the fitter didn’t turn up. Tardy response from customers services. Waiting for final response. Still no refund. A disaster
"It is now cheaper to buy tyres on Ebay and pay to get them fitted yourself. I have also had problems with the tyres since they were fitted. On went down completely whilst I was out working, Causing me to have to go to another fitter and have the wheel shoulder cleaned up and tyre refitted at a cost of £20. The 2nd tyre seems to have a similar problem and goes down slowly."
"Easy, efficient, well-priced service. It gave me a full range of options on tyres and pricing and made it clear the difference between the efficiency of each tyre. I even found a tyre fitter who would travel to me for a small price. Excellent."
"I have had a great experience with [REDACTED]. I just have an issue with the garage that fitted them. They were trying to add extra jobs of cleaning my alloys and sealing as they advised they were badly corroded for a mere £80 for two alloys. Thankfully I refused, I had them checked out by another garage who said they wouldn't charge to do such a thing and that my alloys were fine anyway. STAY AWAY from Laws Tyres, Bridge of Don! [REDACTED], I cant fault, the tyres were a little later than agreed but I was given plenty of notice to re-schedule, communication was great. I will choose [REDACTED] again but deliver to another garage"
Quick delivery and fitting
"Fast easy service, no hassle, let me know the appointment time as well."
"Easy to order on-line and a great all in price(including fitting,balancing disposal etc ) Got an appointment slot for a couple of days after ordering. Dropped car off and went away for an hour,returning to find everything done. Staff at garage pleasant and obliging. Would definitely use this service again"
"Happy customer. I have used [REDACTED] a number of times now, having four cars in the family.Website easy to use, from start to finish there is never a problem and best of all the prices are very competitive.First class."
Very happy with the speed in which my tyres were delivered to garage and I will use [REDACTED] to replace my tyres again
Great value service. Great service and easy to select a local fitter to carry out the job. Best price that I could find online.
"Excellent, very straight forward, tyres ordered and fitted at local garage no hassle and great prices"
Really great service! Fast and friendly. Very impressed! Will definitely recommend to anyone who needs tyres in the future. Website very easy to use too!
The first & last time I will ever use you. I am still waiting for my tyres to be done. You took £190+ from my account straight away. You then cancelled the first job. I complained & was assured it was booked in for a few days later. I was also told I would be refunded for the cost of them coming directly to my house. Wiltshire Tyres then called me that morning to say they had to chase YOU up as YOU had not re-booked my tyres with them. Wiltshire Tyres then called me again today as they were due to come to my house tomorrow 9am-1pm. They informed me that their driver is sick and now I have to drive my car to Andover (40 miles away) to get the tyres fitted. Absolutely TERRIBLE service and I shall pass my experience on to everyone I know.
"Had my original choice of tyres cancelled, was given another set to choose from which I had no choice but to agree becouse they were the only option available to me. Then the next day another email saying I had to change my fitting day becouse the said tyres would not arrive in time. I rang and spoke to a lady and got it sorted eventually and an over of some kind of compensation was given which when the next email arrived nothing was mentioned about. So all in all not very happy at all."
Motorhome tyres. Very easy site to use. Very competitive price and also the option to get the tyres fitted when and where I chose. Also got a discount code for purchasing four tyres. Excellent service at Tyre spot where I had them fitted.
Best price and added discount on 4 tyres . Timescale was a couple of days to fully fit locally at chosen garage. Ultimately you can’t be beaten on price or service time
Continental tyres 10 off promotion. Great price on premium tyres. Easy system for booking. No paperwork to complete at the tyre bay. Hazlmere Mertyre operate on a first come first served basis and it worked perfectly. No due.In and out in approx 30 mins. Staff at Hazlmere were friendly and helpful.
"Very competitive pricing, a good choice of brands and easy tyre fitting arrangement."
identifying the correct tyres was easier on your site than other sites all this worked well. Unfortunately when I went for my appointment the supplier was short staffed and running late so instead of 9.00 am fitting they were fitted at 3.30pm. They did apologise and were very efficient in fitting them. I was unlucky.
[REDACTED]. Simple effective order process best price for quality fitted tyres
Good quality tyres and good experience of getting them fitted fast and very friendly
Very easy to choose tyres of differing types Putting your reg in helps to find the exact size which is important as people tend to change to different types —very good communication and massive saving No hesitation in recommending—thank you
was given time and date arrived tyers were done found my tracing was out asked if I would like it done the showed me how far it was out .igave them the go head to doit all done with in 1 hour very good service
Excellent value for money with a great choice of garages.
"Good price, easy process. Great service from SL."
"The reg checker was the wrong size and poor service. The reg checker was the wrong size. I went to my fitting and they told me after they'd taken my wheel off, so I'd been there about 30minutes for nothing. Then customer service has been very poor via email as have only responded once. Fed up to be honest and still have paid for a tyre but have not been contacted to get a new one fitted."
"Did divert now a returning customer. Tried the [REDACTED] own brand this time. Excellent value, and still look the business on 20's.Much quieter than my old Pzeros.Started using a mobile tyre supplier and fitter in recent times of needing tyres, but got them fitted at a affiliated garage and definitely better balancing. Overall a better experience."
I ordered my tyre and was given a installed date of 9am next morning which would have been the Monday. I then received an email saying that my tyre was not arriving and they could not give me a date for install. Several phone calls over several days an I finally got my tyre installed on the Wednesday
"Availability of an awkward tyre size; good price; quick delivery and excellent fitting service plus an easily navigable web site. Very pleased, will use again and highly recommend."
"Have used [REDACTED] twice over the past years. I have used [REDACTED] twice over the past years and have been satisfied with their tyres (Kumho), prices and tyre-fitters."
"4 new tyres fitted, Springside garage, Irvine.Saved £40 on tyres from regular dealers.The fitting went very very quickly, Amazing service.Very satisfied."
Good service by [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] provided a good service at a good price. Only let down was the filters at the local garage they also did a good job but could have been more careful around the cars with jacks and tools and could have taken more care with my diamond cut alloys. They didn’t cause any damage but the potential to have caused damage was quite high.
"Easy, good garage, professional and reliable"
I could trust the prices quoted and I new the garage I wanted to use
Very poor customer response time.
It was really easy to find and choose the tyres I wanted.
good service and best price
"Easy process, good prices and I liked the ability to choose where to change the tyres AND select date & time. Will certainly use again/Thanks"
Great price. Quality tyres at great prices
Ease of use and impressed with the service from the garage
"Will use again, so easy and the best tyres I have ever put on a car (like zero road noise!). Highly recommend."
Great prices and have so many options for where they can be fitted
Best price and fitted from the garage Ive been using for years. Bought 4 tyres that were fitted at my usual tyre place for £200 cheaper than they could do!They couldn’t even price match as the [REDACTED] price was less than they could get at trade.Very happy
"Good price, good service, when the fitting company couldn’t fulfill the booked time liaised with us to find a suitable alternative."
Simple I turned up tires got fitted jobs done Very straightforward
"easy to use, convenient times at the garage and excellent pricing!"
I was fortunate enough to have an installer relatively closeby.
Easy web site to use at competitive prices
"Good price, good selection of appointments and due to unforeseen problems with my locking wheel nut on one of the wheels the guys were able to find a slot the next day when my second tyre could be fitted."
"4 New Avons. Tyres were at the garage when required, garage was first class."
"Good tyres,good price excellent service from garage fitting them"
Brilliant ServiceNo Fuss. Excellent Service provided by [REDACTED] and partnering garage in Rayleigh. Best price offered for a couple of Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tyres and were fitted by F1 Auto centre in Rayleigh without any problem. Will be buying again in future.Highly Recommended.
very good customer service with findingself explantory. very good customer service with finding the tyres and arranging the time of appointment
"Fantastic value, great garage, great service who could ask for more?"
Fast efficient service . Competitive prices
Excellent service. Loved the home tyre fitting service. Never done it before and was a little sceptical but was brilliant. Will definitely use again!
l have ordered 3 tyres including fitting in a chosen garrage but l never got them on time as l had an MOT booked by the time so l had received an email a bit late that the tyres we not ready for delivery so l had to change my MOT day for the car and it was a lot of hassle for me as to deal with..
"Good price, easy selection of tyre and known time for installation."
Good price for the tyres I wanted. Fitting on time on day of appointment. No down-sides.
I found the price very competitive and the local fitter to be polite quick and professional
Great prices and simple. Very happy with the service. Will use again.
Great price
"Disgraceful response time on extremely dangerous issues regarding brand new tyre. I have reported a large bulge on a brand new tyre purchased on 29.07.2019, it is now 01.08.2019 and all i've heard back is to take a survey to tell you what's wrong and nothing since. I will never use this service again."
"[REDACTED] is the only place to buy tyres. Huge range of quality products at exceptional prices. From ordering online, booking a date and time, payment and confirmation and then tyres changed professionally by a reputable company, it is a seamless exercise throughout. Five star all the way by a company you can trust. Have used [REDACTED] for many years, would not consider anywhere else."
"Good price for tyres required, easy online booking. Fitting centre staff were welcoming and efficient and after 45 minutes all four tyres had been fitted with no issues."
"Tyres fantastic, service could do with some tweeking as boot was left in a state when tyre fitter was looking for the key for the wheels"
Great pricing and excellent local fitting service
"Quick, easy, local installation, good pricing and transparent pricing"
"Excellent all round service. Very good price, good communication, very efficient mobile service for fitting."
Tyres arrived by 2 days. Excellent service at my local garage - Kilgannon Motors.
budget quality tyres.. good grip on wet weather!
"Never going there again. Used the Bletchley depot, The service i got was disgusting. THe staff were more interested in chatting up the young lass in a skimpy top. Took them nearly an hr to change just 2 tyres. Wheels were so badly balanced that I had to get them redone. Where I also found out that the spigot hub rings had been lost so have been driving a car thats been shaking as I drive."
"Great service, but tyre delivery delay meant I needed to rearrange a service and work schedule"
Pricing and local service excellent.
"Excellent service! Just put in your car reg and select the tyres you want book an appointment at the garage you want to get them fitted at from the list, pay and that’s it. Plenty of communication about your appointment. The garage were ready for me with my tyres, fitted them immediately and that’s it. So easy. Will always use [REDACTED]."
Questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience. Firstly the purchasing experience was not great. I entered my registration and was shown the tyres that were supposedly suitable for my car. I was looking for the same Bridgestone S001 run flat tyres. The S001 tyres appeared at the top of the search results and seemed a good price. I ordered them. Instantly I got an email from [REDACTED] saying they think I have ordered the wrong tyres and they ones I ordered were non run flats and my car would have run flats. Looking at the website again the correct tyres were 4 pages down in the search results and a total of £65 more expensive. Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.
"Hi, It was easy way to purchase tyres and with promo code I have saved further 5%. Thanks"
"Good, convenient service from a local garage, at a competitive price"
"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy's fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden."
"Good service, and a good price"
"Good price, excellent customer service very knowledgable"
Nice not only to be about to order the tyres online and save money but also actually to get a variety of choice with actual reviews so you know which tyres would actually suit my requirements. Long gone are the days where the local high street place tells you which overpriced tyres they have in stock or can get in stock!
"Easy service, good comparison for prices"
first class service everything arranged for me made having the job done simple
Good choice of brands and competitive prices. Very smooth process and delivery to a reputable fitter close to me.
"Arrived at designated fitter on time,super tyres,just right for the job,Thanks."
"Great service. Easy to order and fitted at time that suited me at local garage. Very smooth, efficient service and would definitely recommend [REDACTED] to family and friends."
"Cheapest by far in my case, good garage choices and all simple to arrange. Have used them several times now."
"Good price, easy to do and plenty of local tyre fitting locations."
Quick & easy to access site. Large choice of products at various prices. Nearby garages and prompt service.
"Staff where polite but when I ordered tyres 2 days later they say not in stock so ok accepted same make of tyre alternative, but when arrived at garage they had recieved my original order and the alternative so some confusion there ringing and re-booking fittings."
Rude service with attitude at the garage
Have no issues as such with [REDACTED] and price was better than most. However the garage we selected to get our tyres fitted was horrific.
"Excellent easy to use site, very good communication when there was a problem along with competitive prices. Great service at the fitting centre."
"Mistake with the delivery of the tyres meant I could not get them fitted on the day I turned up to the fitters, effectively costing me two days. According to the fitter it's not the first time they've had the wrong tyres delivered to them by [REDACTED]."
"Price is good and being able to choose which garage to have them fitted is also good. However for my order supposed to be fitted Wednesday, was informed won’t be at garage till Friday (not a problem). Turned up Friday garage said sent the wrong size, informed to go back Monday no tyres, they were signed for but delivered to wrong garage. I phoned back Tuesday customer service who said they will send out some more tyres and ended up getting them fitted on Thursday"
Not as competitive as others and misleading “appointments”. Failed to update my order as requested. Fitting service very slow
"Easy process. Quick, professional service installing replacement tyres"
Easy to order and easy to pick place and time for fitting. Good competitive price quoted
Price we excellent and the garage owner where I went was second to none
Quick efficient service well priced
"I had a problem with the fitting centre causing brake dust contamination to the drivers seat which then, through contact, contaminated items of clothing. I rang [REDACTED] and they said they would call me back about compensation and putting it right. That phkne call was due 5 daya ago."
Great savings on premium tyres....have used [REDACTED] twice and very easy process from start to finish
"Beware when ordering. I was quite excited to find a website which when you put your registration in the tyres which you fit to the vehicle come up. Beware I drive a three year old bmw which like most bmw’s Come factory fitted with runflats. The website is not specific on this and I mistakenly ordered the non run flat version as the website indicated this was the correct tyre for my car. The service to get the replacement was good and according to the garage which fitted them this happens quite often. [REDACTED] you don’t need to offer tube tyres for vehicles with run flats, the run flats should come up as first option!"
Had an hour wait before my car eventually went in however apart from that everything that was done to my vehicle was a***
"Good, efficient service. ould ha e got tyres slightly cheaper elsewhere but chose [REDACTED] because of pairing with local garage."
"Straight forward web page, easy to order, tyres all fitted with no issues."
"Easy to organise tyres for my car at a price I liked. Designated garage did a good job installing my tyres. Yes, of course I chose 10."
"Whole process was very convenient and keenly priced. Only complaint was fitter left dirty boot marks on footwell carpet, should have used a paper cover."
Tyres Bridgestone potenza 205 40 17 for Ford fiesta 140 black addition. Put two on front as recommended by another Ford driver. Well tried in f1 against Michelin and Ferrari used them to take Schumacher to many titles so well proven. Haven't been far yet with car but away in two weeks so will then then see what they can do.
"booked appointment not available. I booked the appointment time online which suited me around working hours. I was sent an email the next day saying that they couldn’t do it on that day. I was offered times during the week or the following Saturday. Due to work commitments I had to take the following Saturday which meant rearranging plans. [REDACTED] were very effiecent in rearranging, however I don’t see the point in offering appointment bookings online if they can’t be honoured. The garage that fitted the tyres were excellent. I will try [REDACTED] one more time in the future in the hope it doesn’t happen again."
"Waited far too long to change 2 tyres. When I got the car back there was a noise coming from the rear of the vehicle. Had to take it to bmw, they said whoever fitted the tyres didn’t do it properly. Nit sure what it was myself but bmw fixed the problem for me there and then."
"Excellent website. Easy to use, information was helpful, relevant and well laid out. Prices were excellent and the tyres were available two days later at a garage of my choosing. My local garage that I visited for quotes were so impressed they even said they would take the [REDACTED] deal as it was the best they had heard of."
Website awful. Gives lots of times for appointments and then sends you a text telling you it’s unavailable shortly after completing and paying for an order. You then have to ring up and rearrange everything and chase the operators etc. Non stop. Awful first time experience
easy to order quick delivery
"Good value, speedy, No fuss, No hard sell extras"
"4 stars because of confusion over appointment time and availability of tyres for appointment. Once sorted, absolutely no issue and tyres fitted as ordered and supplied. I would recommend [REDACTED], and definitely use again, as long as it wasn't urgent, due to supply to agent times. In my case I had alternative transport and could wait the 4 days for delivery and fitting appointment. However, consumers may need to change tyres quickly to get home. This would not have suited in my situation, with a spacesaver spare and big hole in main tyre sidewall, had I been 200 miles from home. 20 miles was OK, then a 4 day wait for tyres."
Great quote for tyre to be delivered and changed at our home address. Sorted change in delivery date due to cancellation by garage really quickly and with no fuss. The mechanic who came to fit the tyre was on schedule and efficient.
Needed tyres quick and as close as possible to where I live. [REDACTED] delivered on the tyre price and literally with the mobile fitting!
Fitting of tyres. I My appointment was cancelled because ATS were to busy.I had a perished tyre and needed to have this done as I was travelling. I was not told the fitting date was at ATS descretion. I paid in full and had to wait a further 3 days. ATS were very good and put my spare on for me. If you pay for a service you should get it.
Your price are good but I have been let down twice now with the tyres not being delivered to the fitters in time for my appointment.
Service and price good but mobile fitted put 40psi in tyres that should have been 29psi
great all good nice tyres good price fitted swiftly at the time specified in less than 1 hour.
"Having a BMW with staggered wheels it's very difficult to find x 2 pairs of the same tyre in the same place. I was thinking of removing the run flat tyres from our F31 330d for many reasons but this was a job for the future...... until on my way home from work 2 days before we went on Holiday to France I picked up a puncture. The annoying thing was, the tyres x 4 had loads of life left on them so I had to bite the bullet and change all 4. [REDACTED] were amazing, they were quick and professional even to the point where they had realised that I had ordered non runflat tyres and sent me a warning Email in case I was not aware of my error. The tyres were delivered the next day to the garage of my choice in Lincoln. F1 Autocentres even managed to get the car in a day early so as we could be on our way to Holiday on time. Overall I would highly recommend this service to anyone. Not only for the swift professional dispatch of the order but the amount of money we saved compared to using other well known suppliers. Thank you [REDACTED]."
"Firstly, my tyre was not available on the day I booked. The day before my appointment, I was contacted as the delivery could not be made by the allotted time. This seems like rather poor planning on [REDACTED]' part. I had to change my weekend plans and miss an important event because I couldn't drive the long distance on my tyre that needed to be replaced. Secondly, the available locations were confusing, as there were multiple locations for the same business (Charles Hurst). Having chosen one, when I went to the business on the day, no one seemed to be aware of my booking - either in the chosen location, or in the second location I was sent to. Only the tyre that I had ordered (which turned up at the second location without any mention of a booking) led to the staff at the second location being aware of the booking, and so they were able to carry out the tyre change. The booking system appeared robust and I was pleased with the price, the people at the garage were courteous and the service provided at the garage was good, but the above two points really annoyed me."
"Waste of time. Tyres were ordered on Monday with a appointment for fitment on Wednesday they failed to confirm the appointment due to tyres not in stock knowingly they still took the order and held on to my money even tho the tyres were never sent out would avoid waste of time , spent awful lot of time waiting on phone to get connected to customer service , sent numerous emailed not a single reply total disaster , money still hasn’t been refunded even tho they were meant to do a bank transfer same day"
"Beware of their subcontractors, shower of chyte"
If you know what you want then I would recommend ordering from [REDACTED]. It was easy to find the tyres I wanted and to choose a nearby garage to fit them.
"Good price for product and good choice of fitting station, including the one I would have used anyway, so couldn’t fault the service."
Garage was great and tyres at good price
This was my first experience of going online to choose my tyre and then make an appointment with a local garage to have the tyre fitted. I chose [REDACTED] because of the good reviews I had already read and hoped it would work well for me. I needn't have had any concerns because after ordering and paying for my tyre and choosing one of the two local garages suggested I was more than happy with the service I received. I would definitely use [REDACTED] again.
Easy to book. Guy was really nice. Took me bang on time and finished when he said he would. Professional.
Excellent service - AGAIN. Great fitter and reasonable price to suit my convenience
Price was good and garage was empty so done in 15 mins. Will buy again and use same garage - Just Tyres Wycombe
Your element was excellent however your approved garage was far from it. I turned up 5 minutes before the agreed fitting time at HiQ Neathand they didnt seem bothered. After 10 minutes of waiting I asked what was happening and they said they werent too sure as it was nothing to do with them because I bought through [REDACTED]. They then decided it was time to take my vehicle into the workshop and eventually after 50 minutes the job was done. I do not excpect to wait 50 minutes for 2 tyres to be replaced. Unfortunately they have let you down and would make me think twice about using you again. Id rather pay a few quid extra and have a quicker turn around at my normal garage.
Had to change garage appointment to help them even though at booking it had been free
The price was right and when I took the car to the garage the tyres were there waiting to be fitted.
Easy to use website. Prompt response and delivery to chosen garage.Garage was efficient and courteous .
"Best price out there. Easy, convenient booking. All sundries covered when fitting the new tyres. No hidden costs. Will definitely use again. Highly recommended"
"Good price, quick delivery, right product"
Helpful. Couldn’t be more helpful trying to find a local garage to fit the tyre. Thank you
"Great service but only when the tyres turn up. Great service from the garage that fitted the tyres, but second time now that the promised fitting date was changed because the tyres hadn’t got there. Perhaps I’m unlucky, but this is a cornerstone of the value offered, so [REDACTED] needs to get those tyres to the garage whatever the cost."
"Excellent, efficient service . Extremely easy transaction.Pleasant gentleman who came to our house. So very much better than going to some industrial estate in the middle of nowhere.😀"
"Bit of a Wait. No appointment time possible at the fitting centre I used - so had a bit of a wait. Other than that - service fine, and price for the tyres unbeatable."
"Good tyres at reasonable prices. Purchased two Hankook Ventus Prime 3 tyres to replace two Chinese unknown brand ones that came with the car and were starting to crack. Buying the tyres online from [REDACTED].com was easy and the fitting location was convenient.The welcome on arrival was not the warmest as the guy on duty could clearly have benefitted from some customer service training.However, his colleague Josh, who actually fitted the tyres, was much friendlier and did a good job.Although I've done comparatively few miles on the tyres thus far, I have noticed they seem much quieter than the old ones and the ride is better.Overall a positive experience marred only by the curt welcome at the fitting location."
Great service and good price!!
Good price and good service
"Happy. Quick, easy and a good price."
"Bought 4 Avon tyres for my Passat including fitting etc. for £305 (July ‘19), Excellent value for money."
Excellent price Excellent Service Highly recommended. Excellent price. Excellent service and all work carried out on the drive. Mechanic arrived before expected. Tyre changed and still able to get in to work early. A very impressed customer! Highly recommended and will certainly use again when required.
"Its quick and it's easy and the people who do the job once you take your car there are amazing , this is the second time I've used [REDACTED] and will be doing so in the future."
"Ease of use, convenience and price"
Booking was a bit of a mess. Fitting was great. Price was v competitive.
"The staff are incredibly professional and helpful; especially the individual who changed my tyres. The only issue was the wait time when attempting to phone your customer support, but once answered they were very friendly and helpful"
Price and ease of access to any tyre you want. Also you are able to pick a local garage to fit.
"One tyre went missing, so there was a delay to get the two tyres fitted. The garage a dealt with were fantastic"
"Chose 10 as I checked the prices at my local garages and then checked on [REDACTED] the tyres were 40% cheaper at the local garage that I had just checked ... EXACTLY why would I not chose or recommend them, will never go anywhere else from now..."
"Very good site. Very quick to use online, wide selection of tyres, wide variety of garages to use and relatively cheap. Would highly recommend."
"Very easy to source, compare and evaluate the products and make an informed choice. Easy to book and the garage itself was an absolutle pleasure to deal with (separate review already given). Price was also better and local fitting was more convenient."
"The only way to buy new tyres. This is an excellent way to review, source and compare tyres...and to find a local garage to fit them. Very easy to use the website and very easy to book an appointment. The garage I used was excellent too. Courteous, helpful, informed and prompt staff. A very, very good all round experience with [REDACTED].com"
Easy to use website giving good value for money. When I had an issue with the installing garage they stepped in and resolved the problem to my satisfaction
"Straightforward process, no fuss. turned up to a partner garage and had brand new tyres put on within an hour or so. Very happy with the service"
My tyre get fitted on time exactly which is rarely to happen anywhere. Quick and friendly staff with a competitive price.
"I’m happy with tyres but was disappointed with service this time as I had a 4pm slot booked at the garage, they didn’t even start until half past and it was nearly an hour before I got away. Usually only takes 10-15 mins"
"Well, it seemed like a good idea. But after emailing to say my reservation time was no longer available and I'd have to reschedule my whole weekend and miss out on using my camper. Then get to the garbage and they have no idea that I'm coming. They say the tyre should have been collected on the day it was delivered even though they couldn't fit it. Tyre gets fitted but the garage don't even bother putting the spare back in the carrier. They just leave it in the boot. Not very impressed at all."
Prices are good however arranging fitting has some issues. My original choice of fitting station was fine on check out but was quickly changed due to unavailability of the fitting station. The second appointment was then cancelled and rearranged. If this was a one off it wouldn't have been so bad but it's the second time this has happened.
"The company fitting the tyres, ATS Lymington, were totally lacking in customer service and I waited 2 hours for the work to be carried out whilst they did other cars which people had dropped off. If you book a time for the work to be carried out they should start the work then. You recommend them."
Turned up at the garage at appointed time yo be told Bkack Circles had changed the appointment!
"Easy to order, good price, no problems with fitting. All ok"
"Didn't have the original full set of Pilot Sport 4s I wanted in stock which is fine. Changed order to full set of Super Sports and set an appointment. This then got delayed until next week because the tires didn't arrive at the garage in time. When I picked my car up from the garage, the rear tires were Pilot 4s and the front two were Super Sports. But the order was changed to a FULL SET of Super Sports front and back. This is unacceptable on top of the delays and my original order being out of stock. I won't use this service again and won't recommend it."
"When I turned up for my appointment at ATS my tyres were not there, so I had to rebook. When I picked up my car, the very 1st time I got into it a warning light was on.......all 4 tyyres ranged between 34 and 39 psi, when they should have been at 51. This is wholly unacceptable in my view for a garage to replace all 4 and not bother. Last appointment Fri should not warrant poor and service.......H&S in a car is paramount."
Happy with tyres. Disappointed had to leave car to have tyres replaced. I know the garage was first come first served but I was there before 9 am and told they'd ring me about lunchtime. Which they didn't. I also got no paperwork. Perhaps dealing with [REDACTED] put me down the work order.
Easy to choose the tires and pick a time and date that is convenient.
Fitting date changed post booking. Very inconvienient. Second time this has happened. No evidence of free brake check or free tracking as requested. Vehicle left outside fitters unlocked with keys sitting in centre console when asked to lock and retain keys and we would collect with spare. Vehicle vibrating at speed so doubt wheels balanced properly. Tyres inflated randomly in 4 psi range and incorrect pressure. Rubbish really
Very competitive pricing garage near by to fit the tyres. Only complaint was it took nearly 2 hours to fit them even though only one In The garage at the time.
"Bought some tyres, not pleased with them, unable to return them or even get a discount on a replacement set."
"Your appointment system is not fit for purpose! I booked Wed AM but you offered Thurs PM as the earliest appointment. You also stated that I should arrive early as the garage operates a first come first served. WRONG! They operate an appointment system. Mine was for 15.30hrs which you were informed of but failed to pass on. A reoccurring problem I am led to believe. The garage were excellent and revised their schedule to fit me in earlier. Still a 3hr wait. Your quotes for tracking and alignment were totally inaccurate. The only positive to come out of this debacle, on the day your tyre price was the cheapest I could find."
I compared [REDACTED] to motokiki BC was cheaper. By a small amount. In fact the high Street price was also close for Michelin. But my wife took our car to the garage and she found the reception to be rude and uninviting. The completed tyres had damaged the alloy wheels and the tyre pressures were incorrectly inflated.
"Although initially my experience was goodMy invoice could be changed on request Without full refund which seemed unreasonable , and the service at ATS not good"
The garage that fitted the tyres were clearly trying to deceive me into extra work which did not need doing. So I would not feel able to trust [REDACTED].
Kevin at McKinnon Tyres was very helpful and done a great job
Great service. Friendly fitters arrived on time. Great job.
"Whilst the online system was easy and efficient to use, it transpires that the preferred fitting centre wasn’t available despite being able to book at the time. However good communication via phone sorted another garage out and on arrival at said venue on the agreed day the tires had arrived but no booking was in their system. Lucky slots existed for both my vehicles to have there tires changed around the online booking times but the Garage staff said this was a routine issue with [REDACTED] bookings."
"Had my first experience booked with [REDACTED]. Am impressed the fact when I booked in for two tyres but then was unable to drive there to due medical reason. Luckily I was able to change it for home mobile service and this was completed on the following next day than the original date it was booked it. The fitter was very polite,and professional. Definite would use it again and certainly does save £££"
[REDACTED]. Always have good brands at good prices...never have a problem and they use reliable local garages.
I thought the online booking system was clear and simple and tyres were good value. My minor gripe was a wait at the garage. I never give 10
It was a mess from the get go. The fitting date was messed up three times
garage fitting tyre did not open till 11 once arrived there again took 2 hrs 30 mins to fit the run flat tyre (also scratched inner rim during process)
Because I was very happy with the price and delivery off the Tyres and the tyre fitters you recommended brilliant
Good experience just wish. Good experience and great prices just wish mobile fitting was still an option
"[REDACTED] is an excellent service. The tyre choice is comprehensive, the prices rarely bettered, and the local fitting deals (Wiltshire Tyres in Melksham in my case) work competently and efficiently. Don't have any doubts about sourcing tyres this way."
"[REDACTED] did nothing wrong, except the fitter. I told them i ws on nights, but the didn't turn up till after 6pm (booked 1-6) so there till after 7"
Brilliant great prices great delivery great tyre fitters
"It went smoothly, no problems with the appointment, they were quick and efficient at changing the tyres"
Got cheaper tyres than my normal garage and paid on line for tyre and fitting. The tyres got delivered to a garage close by and I booked a time to get fitted. Had to wait a little bit at garage but that’s not [REDACTED] fault. Overall good and will be using again and already told a few people when they need tyres next to use theses.
"AP DC Autos. Easy to order and arrange to fit with local garage, on the day had a great service from AP / DC Autos in Kirriemuir.Will use this garage again."
Tyres delivered quickly to local garage and attended there. Fitted promptly. Good specialOffer price willRetain custom.
Very easy to book on line. Ready and waiting for us on the day. Dropped the car off and went for a coffee and when we got back it was done. Easy
"Good price ,good service , quality tyres done locally.Im very happy with [REDACTED] and their delivery partner Mc Connachys in Dingwall Scotland"
"The guys who came to install the tyres were great. Super professional, polite and knew their stuff. Please pass on my feedback, they have compelled me to definitely come back again."
"Easy website to use, great selection, garage were great and no issues."
100% customer service. I can't believe how easy your service was to use. Will definitely recommend company to others
"Easy to use, great price and the ATS in Haverhill were great"
Great service and great price.Staff were really friendly and helpful.
All in one price was best I could find and fitting centre was local and done while I waited
I was sent to Shooters Hill Tyres via [REDACTED] and the service was spectacular! Really good service and I’d definitely recommend this service to a friend.
Very competitive price for Michelin tyres. Good booking system. Good communication. Convenient.
Price good as was the service
Price was good and I could use the local garage that I’ve have serviced my car for the last 3 years.
"Good price and good fitting service cannot fault either, thank you."
"Easy & affordable, but cheeky customer service (when tried to get refund for an older tyre ). However, I got it in the end. You should provide tyres with the same date of manufacturer regardless of what the Tyre British association consideration (5 year sell window)"
"Offer competitive prices and including fitting, balancing disposal et. Makes the whole process easy and cost effective. Add to this the customer service and fact they check with you your order is correct prior to dispatch, I cannot fault them."
"When to garage to find no order delivered. Garage used their own stock but unsure it same tyre rating. Issue with fitments, labels left on tryes that had to be powerwashed off amd wheel bolt snapped during fitment. No paperwork amd told Ok to drive with one bolt missing on long journey home. Had to but bolt myself and go vack to garage. Did fit it with no issues or charge but did not leave a positive impression. Garage mot complimentary about [REDACTED] even though they were their partner."
Best price out there also local fitter tyrezone was first class
Quick efficient well priced service
"All lies on website , there are no booking times that are arranged with the tire centre , they have told you constantly but you never do anything about it , if I had stayed I would of waited all day I arrived before centre opens only to find that you have no bookings Won’t be using u again"
excellent value as always. Will continue to use [REDACTED] as good value for money.
"Saved a fortune, served quickly, fantastic garage introduction, amazing service"
Very easy to buy tyres and have them fitted local to me
"Good choice of tyres, best price, convenient local fitting through a fitter I know and trust"
Really competitive prices. Easy to follow web site for the purchase.
"Nice, easy and the cheapest option for tyres at the moment."
"Competitive price and easy to order. Competitive price, easy to order and good communication due to local chosen garage not available to fit the next day.Also a good selection of tyres to suit personal choice / circumstances."
Tyre Change. Great service. Tyres fitted quickly. Pleased with tyres.
easy to book easy all round however try and book a few days in advance of fitting saves time and trouble
good buy. Very reasonable priced and excellent service
Excellent service by staff very efficient and professional
Quick and easy online order system which saved money. Local fitting service with mutually convenient booking Highly recommended
Staff was very helpful and knowledgable. Great customer service
Excellent site great product easy service
Price was good due to a offer
Used BC quite a few times and the service and choice and prices are always great .
First rate service.
"Straight forward, choose tyres and price that suits, no pressure selling, fitted exactly at time arrangd."
"Easy as. Competitive pricing, easy booking of fitting at preferred location."
Very happy with tyres supplied and fitted.
The price and the fitting very good but I’m still waiting for my email receipt
Booking an appointment with a fitter is not as accurate as it should be. Booked for a time slot but was told eight hours later that the time slot was not available. This is the second time this has happened over recent months.
All round easy to use and the garage were brilliant
"Good prices and efficient fitting service. The price for the set of Michelin CrossClimate plus tyres for my Mercedes E Class estate was very competitive and the fitting service was easy to arrange, efficient and friendly."
Excellent prices and fitted at a time that suited me. Excellent service and advice from the staff in the fitting centre.
You cancelled my first appointment because the tyers had not arrived. the men at a t s very good
"past experience combined with this one, good service and good value"
It was very easy to book and the cheapest online.
"Some frustration in not being able to contact you by phone - repeatedly busy. Otherwise, the website works very well - I like the range and pricing and convenience of the connection with a local garage. And when I did manage to speak to someone they were courteous and helpful."
Had to wait another day because tyres hadn't arrived yet
"Although I thought the price would save me a few quid it took 3 attempts, and a week later to deliver my tyres to the fitter. Fitters (Gates tyres Workington) took a long time to fit tyres (over 40 minutes for 2 tyres!) and when my pressure warning system kept warning me to check pressures I found that one tyre was inflated to 35psi and the other to 60psi!"
"Rubbish Website Chasing Around and Misery. Website gives time slots and then sends an email the next day saying to contact them as the garage cannot accept the time. Nothing to do with the garage, it’s the awful website giving out misinformation and false promises. You then have to ring around chasing them up non stop. Awful experience. One I won’t be having with them again."
"Easy and simple. Easy to shop online. Arrived on time at the garage. The garage dealt with me straight away, no waiting. Good experience. Thank you."
"On arrival and throughout my visit to ATS Broadheath I found the staff not engaging. Returning home checking tyre pressures of my newly fitted tyres, both were under inflated."
Premium tyres at a good price fitted locally.
Happy with price and fitting at local garage.
It was quick and easy to book everything using [REDACTED] and it was recommended by a friend.
Very satisfied with the service from CarMaster in Bailleston. Very simple process.
Cheap
"Good service, fitment a day late."
"Good service, helpful staff, great price. What else can I say."
"Far, far cheaper than buying them ‘off the shelf’. The ATS fitting centre were great, they said it would take an hour and called after 55 minutes to say that the car was ready to collect - no dramas, complications or hassle. Website is easy to navigate, have used [REDACTED] for the last 4 years, ever since I moaned to a friend that my BMW runflats were nearly £250 a piece and he said, have you tried [REDACTED]..."
Tyres were spot on and the price was excellent. I'd chose a different fitter next time as ATS were very poor.
"Happy with everything, so Easy to order and get fitted at local garage. Brilliant!"
"I bought two tyres, when I got to the fitters, I thought I'd get a matching pair and change all 4. Cost me £50 extra buying at the fitters!"
"Website easy to use, competitive pricing."
"The service from start to finish is simple and being able to book a time that suits is also very good, the garage that I chose was excellent I didn’t expect my car back for another few hours but it was ready in less than an hour very impressed"
"Much cheaper than anywhere else, and still got fitted locally"
"Great choice and Pricing for tyres.. tend to use other sites for overall opinion of tyres long term. good choice of fitting centres. Silver burn fitting centre, very helpful fitters, but could do with parking bays to leave cars in before and after fitting."
Fast and easy to use service that enabled our tyre to be replaced quickly and at a good price.
Cheapest option around and quick delivery and easiest possible tyre fitters nearby. Delighted.
Easy Efficient and a good price
Hopeless dont bother. The fitting centre wasted my time and didn't fit the tyres I ordered. [REDACTED] customer care were supposed to call me - they didn't. When I got in touch with customer care them they said they would look into the issue and get back to me - they didn't.
"A great all round service. Easy to book online and pick a time preference. Arrived within the time scale that was allocated and promptly changed the tyres whilst the car was on our drive! The technician was friendly, knowledgeable and offered useful practical advice! Would definitely use again."
The only downside was the distance we had to travel to our nearest fitting site.
Great service from your supply partner - completed the works quickly and at the time promised.
"Great prices, so much cheaper than places like Kwikfit. Selected garage was close by and very pleasant. Would recommend [REDACTED]."
Underwhelmed. Chose ATS for fitting who cancelled the chosen appointment slot the day before. Chose another fitting station but had to wait 3 days for fitting appointment. Good service from this one but discovered their price for the same tyres would have been almost £20 cheaper than [REDACTED].
"Great service, good prices, fast & efficient."
"An excellent service. An excellent, comprehensive service at a competitive price."
"Good price for fitted tyres, efficient service as ever. If doing 4 tyres it’s always worth looking for discount codes, or waiting for one of their regular 10% off flash sales - so much cheaper than dreaded Kw@k F@t"
Excellent online ordering and efficient local fitter
Booking was easy but fitting at the nominated garage took way too long at nearly 2 hours for 4 tyres
Tyres OK but fitting was bad. Although the tyres I had fitted were the ones I ordered when I was at the ATS station in Wrexham to have them fitted I was treated very badly by the staff. I would not advocate using this depot to fit tyres again
Really well priced and very easy to arrange.
"Rip off EXTRA cost of 35 for each tyre For valve stem and cap if pressure sensor fitted. Rip off.. extra cost not mentioned on web site or confirmation email.Laws Tyres. Aberdeen charge £35 EXTRA for each tyre with auto tyre presure fitted .I have used [REDACTED] many times in past. And recomend to others Never again. ..Other major tyre garages have this as part if standard charge or under five pound. Not a good deal for me.Nothing on website to warn you. Please ask before going for a fitting if there is any extra cost.Or go elsewhere....Other websites break this down for you to see. Not [REDACTED]. Slim margin for garage on fitting cost.Thus looks like a ""surcharge"" added by garage . Once they have your car on the ramp...."
"Very easy website to use , great choice of tyres at competitive prices, just turn up at your chosen fitters tyres ready and waiting, great service will use again."
"Worked out well. ""Camper"" tyres for motorhomes are not cheap and looking for the Continental Vanco version never easy, [REDACTED] came in as the cheapest supplier. With a van as high as mine and low emission zone restrictions it's difficult to find somewhere to go and [REDACTED]'s list of fitters and the map made this a relatively easy process, it turned out to be the garage I always use for my motorhome and was due to take it for an MOT anyway!"
"Great service. A good price, fitted within 24 hours at good local tyre company. Deserves 5 star rating"
"Great range of options with good reviews to help you decide. Prices are good, supported by a quick and efficient delivery. Garage used for fitting very professional. Have been hesitant previously to use this method of purchase however it will be my go to option for the future."
Great Value. Excellent value and very easy to arrange fitting
"Good value, quick. No problems."
Just booked a slot at local ATS and that's it
I have always dealt with [REDACTED] reason being you are treated well great customer service and dedicated great garages
Bridgestone tyres 205 40 17. Excellent price for top grade tyres. Well pleased and will buy from here again. Will recommend to everyone.
Easy to book on line at local garage. Friendly and helpful staff did a great job and did it quickly as promised. Will us again.
Decent price and good fitting station (Mr Tyre Derby) No haggle approach and voucher discounts make [REDACTED] a decent choice
Felt like there were hidden costs on arrival at the fitting centre
The correct tyres were fitted at my home. The fitter was quick and efficient but took care of alloy wheels.
"Very simple and easy service to use, very competitive prices. Definitely recommend"
The Tyre fitter who fitted my new tyres damaged all of the wheels due to poor fitting equipment and a lack of care and skill whilst removing the tyres. Its clear [REDACTED] do not pay attention to the people they trust to complete the transaction/tyre fitting and for this reason I will never use them again or the garage who fitted the tyres which is Treadmark Tyres of Canterbury.
Great service. The tyres were delivered to my local ATS Euromaster as requested. The guys at ATS Euromaster were very helpful and efficient.I highly recommend [REDACTED] and ATS Euromaster in Didcot.
"Great price , and simple to have the tyres fitted"
Good tyres messed around in fitting. Good tyres at a reasonable price.Fitting service wasn’t perfect. I was pushed back 3 days from my chosen and accepted fitting day.
"Poor information if tyres not delivered. I ordered tyres and set the fitting date for 1 wheel later. I received a confirmation email later that day.On arrival at the garage I was informed that the garage had been shut for the last 2 weeks due to their summer holiday. The tyres had therefore not been delivered. I received no email or call for [REDACTED] to say that the tyres had not been delivered, so I wasted time (taken as time off from work) going to the garage.I rearranged the fitting and only got confirmation at 10:10pm the night before which is too late to rearrange my work for the following day.May I suggest that in future if the tyre supplier cannot make the delivery that you inform the customer? A simple thing to do by email and good business manners. Confirmation emails should also be sent earlier (I called the fitter to ensure delivery 2 days prior and they had already taken delivery of the tyres), so why the delay in contacting me?"
Never have I experienced any problems with [REDACTED] . Garage is close to my home and staff are very helpful if you have any questions
"Because even though we had an issue with the fitting date, [REDACTED] recompensed us for the inconvenience."
Great service Although the fitter got over zealous revving my motor on the ramps 😂
"Easy & affordable, but their customer service was reluctant when tried to get refund for an older tyre. However, I got it in the end.You should provide tyres with the same date of manufacturer regardless of what the Tyre British association consideration (5 year sell window)"
"[REDACTED] and Hillam tyres. Would recommend Hilliam tyres, the fitting partner I used with [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] were excellent,all in all the whole experience was excellent.will use again."
"- Easily understood website - simple procedure for selecting tyres ...but could be better in ensuring the particular tyre I wanted was the one finally selected not others similar. - very clear indication where local tyre fitting was available - simple payment process, although I couldn't see during the payment procedure confirmation at any point that the price included VAT (it does) which would have helped, perhaps I missed it, if so it could be made more clear. - Fairly quick delivery to local fitting garage, for some perhaps could be faster but suited me. - Courteous and efficient garage staff, very helpful and this was much appreciated."
"Bad experience.Made booking for Thursday, organised my day to fit the booking, they then advise that the booking wasn't possible, so had to re-arrange for 10am Friday morning, again I arranged my day to fit it in. Turned up at garage who had the tyres but knew nothing about the booking and said they couldn't fit me in until 2pm. Had to return home to re-arrange my day and then called [REDACTED] who then advised that the next available booking was for Tuesday!!! Needless to say I cancelled the whole thing and will not use or recommend [REDACTED] Thanks guys, you really screwed my days up."
"Straight forward, value for money, excellent service from chosen garage..."
Cheaper tyres than most places.
I’ve used [REDACTED] a number of times in the past unfortunately this was not the best experience as they messed up my appointment time which ruined my plans for the day
Very simple to do and saved me money what more could you ask for
"Disappointed. OK. But not that much cheaper than anywhere else. Also the voucher code didn't work despite having 4 Bridgestone tyres fitted, I feel its unfair to penalise people just for having different front and rear tyre sizes. Not sure if I would use again. Dissapointed."
Because my booking time was changed from 9.00 to 11.00 and when I got to garage was informed I was booked in for 10.00 and told I felt rudely that I was to late even as I attempted to show the email that said 11.0O only to then be told ow your in for 11.00 as well I guess we can do you then.
red dot not opposite valve. Great price and service although fitter didn’t put the red dot opposite the valve so more balance weights were required
On entering your site filling all out entering codes still had to pay full price
"Called the night before to arrange time for following day, arrived on time, very polite and professional. Very happy with the service and will definitely recommend and use again myself."
Excellent service. Good choice of tyres and prices. Excellent service at the garage
The correct tyres were delivered (JLR specific ones) and fitting went very smoothly.
Dead Easy. No hassle and quick turnaround with local reputable fitter.
"Value for money, quick delivery and fitting available."
Reasonable price and friendly staff
Excellent service from [REDACTED] and Selecta Tyre
"Taranasus seal of approval. I mean what's there to fault? I placed the order, tires arrived on time, the service was very professional even though it was a local-operated business. They even troubleshooted a problem I had with the car which was not their fault or responsibility and didn't charge me anything for it. Took only 40 minutes to do both tires. A++"
"Great prices, no fuss and tyre fitted quickly at a local garage."
"Booking easy, garage ready when I arrived and did job straight away."
"Have used [REDACTED]'s previously, excellent value and service then and still the same now, will use in the future ,I recommended this service to family and friends who have since purchased their replacement tyres ,all of whom are very satisfied ."
Motel is a friendly and very efficient garage. It certainly is a great ambassador for [REDACTED]
"Good garage, on time"
Turned up 10 mins before my appointment was greated by a fitter who told me my car would go in after he had finished up a job. Made to feel very welcome had a coffee and my vehicle went into the workshop at the time i booked. Really great service from the Team at ATS Frome.
"Used [REDACTED] three times now and always been very pleased with the service provided, and fitted on time by HIQ Dukinfield."
Initial tyre fitter was was unavailable despite confirmation
"Great serviceprice. Good service from ATS, good price from [REDACTED]"
Pleased overall although there was a delay in my order resulting in me having to change fitting date as they were not delivered in time. Price was good and the process was easy and straightforward. Would use again.
"Gave me an appointment at garage when tyres were not there. Didn’t put car on ramp to check tracking, I was told that, so I doubt very much they did the other free checks."
Excellent range easy to find the tyreseasy. Excellent range easy to find the tyres I wanted. Got 10% off booked fitting time I wanted. Will use again.
"Safety Issues. Chose a local dealership to fit the tyres. Drove the vehicle to a remote holiday cottage and one of the tyres had deflated. Managed to get it to a tyre centre, a few miles from the cottage, where I was told it hadn't been sealed properly.[REDACTED] responded with an apology and a very modest compensation offering, given the safety issue at stake. The compensation is yet to arrive."
"Great service no hassle. Great service. Have used these folks several times. Just look on the site, good range of tyres and great prices. Pick your garage to have them fitted. turn up done, no hassle at all."
"The whole process ,from the ordering on line and having the Tyre fitted was quick and easy ! The price I paid was all inclusive , drove in to Tyre center , and drove out within ten minutes ."
"Very good service as ege Goodyear tyres. Very good service as e.g.e r, love the Goodyear tyres."
"Good prices, good choice and convenient fitting."
"Fine no complaints. Can't complain. Tyres I needed were available, and the fitter was fantastic, taking extra time on my somewhat fiddly to change wheels to ensure he didn't damage them. Well done all round really. Only negative was the tyres weren't cheaper than buying direct from a garage, but worth it for the convenience."
Most of the tyres in stockA good amount of partners where you can get tyres fittedCompetitive pricesGood website
Booked in and confirmed A.M appointment via [REDACTED] but garage unaware of booking when I arrived meaning 2 hour wait for tyres to be fitted.
"Easy to select tyres, easy to select fitting station and good service"
Delivery was only partial so couldnt do complete installation
Great prices. Easy to use local trusted garage.
"Very easy to arrange, and a great price. What more could you want!"
"Competitive pricing, let's you choose the tyre you want rather than restricted to what the garage has in stock"
"the web site was easy to use ,the tyres were a good price and i got excellent service from the recomended garage i used"
Great choice. Best price. Great service. Simple.
Easy to use website and great prices
"Easy ordering, good prices."
"A top all round experience the future of tyre sales. A great choice of products; very competitive prices. Fitted locally, at a time which suited me. A great service indeed!"
Good way to fit new tyres. I have used [REDACTED] several times over the last 10 years and always found them to have good competitive prices for a wide selection of tyres. Installation service at my local independent small garage has also been excellent. Experience is better than past at places like Kwikfit etc. eg. I just paid £500 for four Bridgestone/Michelin tyres for my BMW where Kwikfit charged £500 for two when my old BMW failed its MOT there!
Seamless and professional service Excellent. The website is easy to navigate and makes choice and booking easy. The fitting centre was professional and staff were friendly and helpful.
"Fantastic service, ended up a day early than forecasted for delivery, and great value for money"
"Good company. Correct tyres, very good garage fitted them. [REDACTED] very good when I cancelled Fitting date due to breakdown. Helpful. Used them before and will use again."
"Awful experience. First agreed fitting date cancelled the night before. Second time an appointment booked apparently, garage knew nothing about appointment time, and to top it off only 2 tyres delivered to the garage instead of 4. I spent 5hrs at the garage. Only positive I can give is Jamie did resolve the issue and I had tyres fitted."
Used [REDACTED] a few times now and cannot fault them .The tyres are cheaper than buying from the garage that fits them.Straight forward convenient and no reason to go anywhere else
Tyre buying made easy. A very simple process from ordering through to fitting by my selected local garage. No more than 40 minutes for 2 front tyres to be fitted by friendly efficient staff.
Great quick service polite fitters
"5 as always. Great service, quick fitment. 5*as always"
"Always excellent pricing and good delivery times, so convenient that I can get fitting at my regular garage also."
"The quality of the tyres are fantastic and the price is fantastic,the garage that fitted my tyres were very polite and professional"
"Very easy website to use. Pick your tyres, book your car in. Simple!"
"Excellent comunication ,very good price also good choice of fitting centre."
"Very reasonably priced tyres, easy to use website and a good choice of fitting stations."
"Competitive prices , tyres were fitted as per appointment , very good service."
Service as described and great price for tyres and fitting A+++++
"Easy to use service, good quality tyres. Great service from the chosen tyre specialist. I would be happy to recommend and use again."
"I have been a user of [REDACTED] for many years due to the excellent and user friendly web-page. In addition, the offering of various manufacturer specification and all inclusive costs is truly excellent and unique, clear and uncluttered. Last but certainly not least I have used the same fitter for all my cars over many years and also that of my wife and son, and would have no issue in recommending them highly enough. Pleasant, courteous, fully respectful and careful in handling the alloy wheels and the car itself whilst in their possession. Totally excellent small local garage, professional and top class customer service. Well done Black-circles and the local garage. Keep it up."
"Josh and Richard were the ultimate dream team at Bar Hill! They were super helpful, friendly and incredibly thorough. I couldn't recommend them more. Thank you boys!"
Used my regular tyre place down the road ! But through [REDACTED] ! Had a wider choice and cheaper range through [REDACTED] than going directly to the tyre place directly.
"Easy, hassle free, good price and availability of fitting centres"
Unbeatable for Tyres. I always buy my tyres from [REDACTED] because they cannot be beaten on price and they have a wide range of products. Their customer service is always excellent and it’s so easy to book in your local garage.
A8 X 4 tyres. Superb service and process. Was wary of tyres from one place and fitting from another but worked just fineUsually a Kwik Fit user but they had a limited choice of tyres whereas [REDACTED] had good choice and good prices.
"Purchased 4 tyres, car returned in perfect condition, no hesitation in recommending this garage."
"Very Competative pricing, a local garage to fit"
"The centre which was supposed to fit my tyres failed to do so. They gave two reasons, one to do with the difference in tread between the new tyres and the existing ones and they also claimed that they tyres supplied may have been for a BMW X5 rather than a BMW X3 - they would have to check 'the dots' but didn't do so. They claim there is an issue with the [REDACTED] website so that customers with X5s or X3s regularly order the wrong tyres...……."
the fitting centre didn't fit the tyres - I felt I was fobbed off with excuses. I contacted customer services who were initially helpful but after the first contact haven't given me an update and haven't responded to my follow up e-mails requesting an update
Easiest way to purchase tyres dontBargains. Easiest way to purchase tyres don't have to shop about.
Great price and service. I have used [REDACTED] before as they are very competitive and efficient. Their website is easy to use and entering your Reg No ensures you are presented with the correct tyres. I was able to select a local ATS garage and the appointment was for 2 days ahead. Buying 2 tyres also gave me a small discount. I'm happy to recommend [REDACTED]
My issue is with your agent who damaged refurbished alloys but refused to accept responsibility despite us providing photo evidence that the wheels were unmarked when the car went in to them. This is not the first time Mercia Motors have damaged the wheels but will be the last as I will not use them again.
"Second time I've used [REDACTED], so convenient, no waiting at garages for a slot, just book and turn up .And the tyres I and my son have bought have been better quality and cheaper than going to a high street tyre dealer. 5 star rating from us."
I had 4 pre arranged bookings cancelled and nothing by way of an apology from [REDACTED].
"Ordered 2 new tyres, given a date for fitting then message saying they had not been delivered. Got a new date and guy turned up to fit them, wrong size of tyre, given new date again and was cancelled the night before the fitting via email. The next day a message from the fitter saying he was there to fit the tyres, good job from the fitter but poor getting them fitted. Given £21 back because the tyres which i had been charged for were more expensive than the actual ones which should have been delivered, still waiting for the refund after 7 days"
"Just any excuse not to be ripped off by Kwikfit! Good prices on a lot of brands. I went for [REDACTED] Quality Choice, and I am not disappointed, much quieter than my old P Zeros!"
[REDACTED] as a whole I would recommend but not the garage I had tyres fitted at. Both alloy wheels were completely covered in grease! No attempt had been made to clean the grease off
Good service - but a bit clueless at the fitting centre.
Ease of use is highly rated! Would have been. 10 except [REDACTED] booked my tyre appointment over the lunch hour of my chosen garage! This meant the appointment was not booked into their calendar
"Great service, really happy. Only down side was that the timed slot really wasn’t a specific appointment, but the guys were great"
"Exceeded my expectations !Having had a look around on-line, I found that [REDACTED] pricing was far easier to understand than the others. Rather than sucker you in with a low tyre price then add everything on after they gave a price and stuck with it. I had all 4 tyres done, took advantage of an offer they had on Michelin tyres and was pleased with the service. Arrived at the fitting partner, tyres there, job done.Thank you"
Excellent service for 2 tyres fitted at home. Fitter was prompt and professional and got the job done quickly. Thank you
"Good quality, good choice, excellent delivery and logistic organisation. Everything worked out well."
"Two tyres for BMW excellent job. Two tyres for BMW, were the best price available by quite some margin, easy ordering process, and fitted at a local excellent garage."
"Its convenient. I can choose whatever fitting option suits me. The mobile fitter I have used the last two occasions has been excellent. I would only add that maybe a loyalty scheme woulld be a great idea. I have used [REDACTED] for many years now and I'd like to think that you could work your way up to a decent discount at a certain interval, or a waived mobile fitter fee or something. There is such competition now for prices and rewarding loyalty goes a long way. I find the competition things that appear at the end of a sale a faff to be honest. Having to log into one thing or another to get 5 free entries on this or another 2 on that. I'd rather go in and buy my tyres and earn something for my loyalty."
Great price and slick service with local garage
Found a much cheaper price than I was quoted by ATS - almost half the price. Also led me to a local garage I hadn’t used before but will in future.
"Good price great service. Good price, brilliant local service at a prearranged time, so no waiting around for fitting."
"The whole ordering process was relatively simple, and the fitting company was excellent, taking care over details, being ready to do the job at exactly the pre-arranged time. The 10% discount for prompt ordering was a bonus, also."
Great products at good prices. Will fit here in the highlands of Scotland
Very friendly and helpful staff very good prices on tyres
Only 1 tyre arrived at fitting centre
Very easy to do. Options to suit me. Competitive price
Because I was able to pick and pay for my tyre before going to the garage (which coincidentally is one I use for services etc anyway). So none of this nonsense you get at Kwik Fit where they never have the budget tyre advertised in stock and get you to buy a much more expensive one. Then try to hit on you for your other tyres and brakes etc.
Very good prices and local fitters
V good
Very professional service from placing the order to the fitting of the tyres
Good Price on Tyres. Easy booking system.
No time wasted. Tyres were available and fitted quickly
They had the exact tyres I was after and I was even able to select my local garage for the installation.
Good service. Very easy to manoeuvre website.
Excellent service and at a competitive price. Fitted locally and at date/time to suit me
had the tyres I wanted at a reasonable price fitted by a very professional garage very quickly.
"It couldn’t be any more simple, choose your tyres, choose your fitting garage and date, pay, then go have them fitted, plus you save loads of money. Very happy indeed"
Easy and quick access to find the correct tyre size. Step by step instructions Also a great 10% off for my first tyre
"The process was easy, the price was good and the fitter provided an excellent service."
"AVOID [REDACTED] their mobile fitting service. On Sunday (04/08/2019) we had paid and booked for a tyre to be fitted on Wednesday (07/08/2019)We had been given the option of an AM or PM booking (no time specific) We chose an AM booking. Tuesday evening came an email at 17.31 saying there had been a delay on the tyre and they needed to reschedule to Friday. This was no good to us as we needed it fitting Thursday at the latest due to a long drive. The option to call them straight away wasn't there, as their offices close at 17.30 coincidentally! Called them first thing Wednesday AM, my partner stressed that a fitting for Friday was not possible and Thursday would be the latest we could have it done.After speaking to the woman on the phone for 10 minutes and a few back and forth phone calls later, she agreed to have a fitter come out and fit the tyre on Thursday (AM) email confirmation received stating AM delivey/fitting.Thursday 11:30am and the fitter still hadn't arrived. My partner rang [REDACTED] and she said that an AM booking is anywhere between 9AM &1PM. 1:30PM and the fitter still hadn't arrived. She waited an hour and rang [REDACTED] back, after a few back and forth phonecalls they said the fitter was stuck in traffic, and possibly wouldn't be able to get to her till after 5PM.My partner suggested they came to our house after 5pm as this really needed doing and we had aleady been let down 3 times, [REDACTED] gave us the number of the fitter so we could contact him.5:15PM and still no sign of the fitter at home. My partner decides to ring the number that was provided.The fitter said that [REDACTED] should of told us that he wouldn't be able to get to us till tomorrow morning now.My partner said it needed to be done today. He said he would get in touch with a fitter and get back to us. 7:12 and we still haven't heard anything from anyone. My partner tried calling [REDACTED], but their offices are now shut. My heavily pregnant partner is now unable to attend her hospital appointment now, due to [REDACTED] incompetence not to mention the amount of stress caused."
Good price and easy to organise fitment
"nice to have tyres fitted at home , have used [REDACTED] for a number of tyres , will use again , good price to."
Notified the day before fitting that delay to delivery of tyre and next available fitting was a Saturday 3 days after original booking. Had no option but to rearrange my weekend as a result. Then I received an email 2hrs after my original appointment advising the tyre had been delivered which was a slap in the face. Also when I the wait time while attempting to contact [REDACTED] via telephone was ridiculously long. The call handler also continually laughed and giggled when I told her my name. Pretty sure if I had laughed at her foreign name it would be classed as racism. Not impressed. No issues with the fitting centre itself. The guys were pleasant and completely professional.
Good price and product.
"[REDACTED] Value for money. Ordering tyres from [REDACTED] was straightforward, on special offer days, advantageous discounts are available. An enormous selection of tyre sizes and types is listed, and you are directed to the nearest tyre fitters in your area, with your purchased tyres delivered to your chosen fitting shop (if the fitter doesn't stock what you asked for). [REDACTED] operates through businesses that offer good and efficient services."
"Recently purchased a tyre, and found it cheaper at Asda 8%, questioned if price match answer was a definite no. Not even a discount code if purchasing more tyres, would recommend to people to check other sites before selecting. Asda was cheaper and quicker and used exactly the same fitting centre"
the garage you recommended ruined my wing on my car as they put the wheel clamp in the wrong position and never told me
"Good price, quality product and local fitter was quick and efficient."
"Friendly Excellent Service. Friendly , well run and helpful team run this garage !!... will recommend to all my friends and family ! And use again myself soon"
"Get your order right. I used [REDACTED] because a friend recommended them. They’re fine if your order goes through as originally booked. I had to postpone the appointment because of a flight cancellation and I was then in the hands of customer services who are very slow. I also, stupidly, made the wrong tyre selection when ordering. This resulted in further postponement. To [REDACTED]’ credit, they did give me a 10% discount after a second delayed encounter with customer services. Moral: get your order right in the first place and pray that your appointment doesn’t have to be delayed for any reason 😊"
I bought 4 tyres in Ormskirk at [REDACTED] branch and requested to check my brakes. They didn't check. Why? I'm very disappointed.
smooth transaction; telephone help avaiable if required.
Quick easy and very good pricing
Good price
"tyres in stockgreat price and fitters. had the tyres in stock,price fitted was good and the fitters were great."
Great site and an excellent service from pro grip. So easy to use and all fitted at a time to suit me by a professional and friendly fitter.
Quick service and delivered on time. Service at the garage chosen was excellent as always.
"The service was excellent! The nominated repair site I chose were fantastic. The owner was so friendly and my front two tyres were changed so quickly. Quality product, great service, fantastic price."
Excellent prices and service. Connected to a local fitter who came to our house and changed two tyres. Would use again for sure.
#NAME?
"Reasonable price, fast fitting"
"Very happy with using [REDACTED].com I could get a good selection of tyres ,giving me great choice on specification and price. They where delivered to my chosen garage & the fitting service was excellent."
"[REDACTED] were great value for money. I went to ATS Euromaster & the service was great. However, I needed another tyre & ATS Euromaster were a rip-off charging my £100 for what was a Budget tyre. So....check ALL your tyres before you Order on [REDACTED]!!!"
Cheapest about and for the same quality of tyre
Easy to order and reasonable price. Would have been 10 but the fitter damaged my alloy. Noticed it too late to complain. I did wonder why the car was parked against the garage when I picked the car up.
"Superb, very easy to use and 25% cheaper than I had been quoted by the garage who actually fitted them. Will definitely recommend."
Delayed fitting due to only 3 of 4 tyres being delivered.
Easy and cheap to get tyres done in a local garage.
You offer fair prices and exceptional service though out local fitting company Autotest.
Overall price is competitive.
Good value reliable service.
easy quick and good value service
Competitively priced tyres. Easy from start to finish. Excellent service.
"Spot on. Good website, easy to place order and pick a local company /time for fitting. Competitively priced."
"Good experience using [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] have a great selection of tyres from all price ranges and brands. The website is very good and easy to navigate. I chose the fully fitted option and was able to have four new tyres of my preferred brand on the car within 36 hrs of first logging in to the website. The fitting garage was only a few miles from my home, and did a first class job. Both organisations deserve unreserved recommendation."
"TOTAL SHAMBLES. Total shambles, original fitting date cancelled for no reason, when rebooked for another date the fitters had no knowledge of it effectively causing me to have to drive on illegal tyres. Massive wait times while on hold to try and resolve, totally inadequate responses and resolution. Legal action to follow. AVOID."
"All was good. Tyres delivered to fitter and fitted on date and time booked. Price of tyres seemed competitive and an upfront all inclusive price which includes valves, balancing and disposal of old tyres, unlike on some of the dealers web sites, meant knew what it was costing before hand."
"FAB Service. Excellent service. Easy to order, chose the day and time I wanted, dropped the car off and within the hour I had a call to say the work was done and the car ready to be collected."
Cost and satisfaction
Price
Competitive prices and consistently excellent. This has been the case for many years. No problems with the tyres being sent on time to the fitters or the fitters themselves.
"Great service. Easy way to find best tyres.Direct, no fuss and easy to use"
Quick and easy to use. The garage I selected did not have the time I selected but managed to get me in on the same day (and only an hour later) which was really helpfull. I recieved emails in regards to the issue and it was dealt with quick an effectively.
Quick and easy to find tyre and order. Appointment times were fab. And the customer service from the staff at silverburn was outstanding.
"So it was my first time ordering from you - the website, great, easy to use. Purchasing the tyres and selecting the extra for the tracking - great, no issues at all. I bought on the 27th and it was confirmed on the 29th for fitting on the 31st. I was then contacted on the 30th to advise there was a delay in delivering the tyres so they changed the fitting day to Friday 2nd August (Today) Upon arriving, the order (I looked on their screen) was for 1 tyre to be fit, not 2. They called through to try and sort this, which took a few attempts but got resolved. I also noticed that on their screen they had the tyres on the 30th? So all in all, a poor first impression, a terrible second impression and possibly a lie/miss-communication for third?"
"Good customer service. Easy to buy the tyres via the website and select the garage you want them fitted at, on a day and time that suits you. The prices are usually very good too, especially if there’s a sale on or discount code. You can either wait with your vehicle or go off shopping etc, while the tyres are being fitted. Took about 20-30 mins for my front two tyres to be fitted. It’s good that they don’t use the wheel nut air guns (as these can damage and cross thread wheel nuts). Instead they hand tighten the wheel nuts first and then manually torque wrench them on at the correct setting."
I booked 4 appts that all showed as available and in each case the appointment was cancelled. This was both disruptive from a practical perspective and also each cancelled appt took 3 working days to refund. There was very little in the way of an apology and certainly not a great customer experience.
"Good but not great. Good: Headline price was on a par with other online retailers. Good choice of local tyre fitters.Bad: There was a discount code for 10%, which I entered in the apprioriate box, rushing to place my order an hour before the offer expired. But the 10% discount was never applied. Kept thinking it'll show in the next step but it never did."
"Was messed around quite a lot - times rearranged due to tyres not being delivered, then put back to the original appointment - without cancellung the changed one. Will go directly through the garage next time. [REDACTED] messed me about too much for the same price as the garage would have given without them."
"Tyres fitted at home, excellent tyres, excellent service, all at no extra cost."
Excellent tyres for a good price fitted conveniently.
excellent value. Allowed change inbtyre after realising error following order. local garage used to fit tyres were good and allowed me to get tyres a day early.
"Booked online & fitted at my local garage, straight forward & good price."
"Very easy process, good website. Quick service and good garage options! Price was very competitive."
"Great value as always, easy arranged. Thanks"
"Considerable confusion over fitting date. I was asked by email to change the day I had booked, which I said I was happy to do, but received no confirmation. I subsequently had to phone CS to ask if it was confirmed, at which point I was given another day (which I accepted). I was then worried about the fitter turning up on the previously agreed day so I contacted the fitter directly to make sure."
Was straight forward and a good price plus the garage I used gave me good service
"You gave me a garage appointment when tyres were not there. They fitted tyres next day, he didn’t check tracking he told me and therefore I doubt very much if he did the other free checks too. Therefore I did not rate the service at all and will not be using you again or recommending you either."
"Tyres did not arrive when said they would and it was really important that I got them on time, so for me as I said at time would never use you again, garage was fine no problems that side of job."
"Excellent service from start to finish. Would highly recommend, with their fitting service included it’s hard to find a better price for tyres, fitting balancing and disposal of old."
Price and service from ATS
"Good price punctual great fitting service by ATS. Correct tyres arrived at ATS local National chain on time, and fitting was undertaken at the booked time. My Mercedes SL500 is particulraly sensative to poor wheel balancing particularly getting the inside of the rim balanced agsinst the outside. ATS did this perfectly. They were also able to undertake 4 wheel alignment at 1/2 the price of my local small specialist Mercedes garage (not even the main dealer). The price was as good as any of the other online supplers. As I often find Y rated Dunlops were cheaper than W rated tyres. Perfectly legal to fitted higher rated tyres than minimum requirement. These were also MO fitment tyres"
"Great prices appalling organisational skills Would not use again. I needed tires fitted at the weekend as mine were severely worn according to my MOT and I had a number of journeys to make with some pretty appalling weather forecaster. A friend suggested I check out [REDACTED], the prices looked great and a good range of local garages (5 within 6 miles or so of me) so I went ahead and placed an order. The following day (Friday) I received an email from them saying they couldn't book me in on the Saturday at my chosen garage and the next available slot was the following Monday. I replied and asked them to look at other garages in the area as I needed them fitted that weekend. About an hour later I received a follow up email telling me it was too late for them to deliver the tires to any other garage for the following afternoon and that the next available appointment was now Wednesday! I asked for my money to be refunded and figured I would just book myself in with a local garage instead as they had plenty of spaces to do the fitting when i needed it. Heard nothing back and no refund which meant I couldn't book in at the local garage instead. Followed up on the Monday to the customer service department and again heard nothing back. I ended up having to send an email to a different department, along with a complaint which resulted in my payment being refunded. No apology for the inconvenience or anything like that and then a follow up email asking me to review my conversation with someone I had never spoken with. I presume all the good reviews on here are people who haven't had an issue and everything has gone smoothly and all power to them, just beware that if something does go wrong with your order it seems you're stuffed trying to sort it out."
"I had to cancel my first order because of mixed tyres, I reordered new tyres and had same booking date and time but when I arrived at garage the job was not on their system as the call handler at your company neglected to put the job through to Collinson’s so I had wasted a days holiday from work for no reason. I was not even offered an explanation as to the reason for the mess up. I thought I might have been offered some kind of remuneration as I had lost a days holiday from work due to [REDACTED] foul up."
Excellent web page. Ease of use. I got the right tyres at the right price.I had these tyres fitted at ATS Ilkeston and the fitter Brian was exceptional with a great customer service.Thank you.
"Excellent service, had to change location of repair and all done easily with great communication"
"Very easy to use, website very user friendly lots of choice, fitting garage excellent service"
Excellent customer service..very friendly staff..and fitted on time and quickly..I've used twice before and will continue to get tyres from [REDACTED]!
Price and local fitting agent.
"Excellent service and price,Good communication from [REDACTED].Easy and convenient. Would use again and highly recommend."
Good price. Easily arranged fitting which was quick. Good service and will use again.
Excellent service and saved a few pounds Will definitely be using [REDACTED] again.
"Ordered tyres and paid for them , gets phone call and email following day to say tyres out of stock and offered poorer tyres ( dearer but said they would price match ) . Chose other tyres then got email saying they were getting fitted in different garage 10 miles away when original garage was 600 yards away , after yet another phone call ( 20 mins on hold this time ) was changed to correct garage . Have used [REDACTED] before with no probs but on this occasion very poor."
Excellent value tyres fitted by an excellent local garage.
Great prices and superb service from local fitter
"Good prices. Easy ordering and arranging of fitting. One price includes everything, no hidden extras."
Happy customer. Low price and the quickest fitting at the garage I've ever had. Tyre Stop I think it was called in Mold. Will definitely use them again.
"Very good service from Bond Street Garage..fitted on time and very quickly, enjoyed the chat with the receptionist!! Good price from [REDACTED]."
"I had a bit of hassle initially trying to get it booked, not helped by the person dealing with it not reading the information correctly"
The buying experience was good but the garage experience was not
"I have used you in the past and had excellent service, the past company I had the tyres fitted at were excellent, but no longer one of your options for fitting now. I chose your premium fitter in Basingstoke, Formula One Auto - and they were awful. Their customer service was non existent. I phoned up and got a quote for having the wheels tracked, they quoted £36 for front and £52 for front and back if needed, but I probably only had the fronts that it was possible to do. With this I sent my husband to have the tyres fitted, so when they charged him £48 he paid assuming it had been front and back that needed. They took nearly 23 hours from our apointment to fit the tyres, way longer than it should have for 4 tyres. I phoned them and said that the paperwork clearly stated only the front had been balanced and was given a wishy washy excuse for the over charge, which, because I know about cars I knew to be rubbish, he then said that they couldn't refund the over charge directly and needed to have a cheque sent to me, which I would get in a week. I then discovered the next day when I took the car out for a drive that they had under inflated all of the tyres by 5 to 7 psi. After 10 days I phoned back and advised the regional manager who answered the phone at the branch about the under inlfation and that the cheque had not arrived. I was promised a call back, which never came. A week later I chased again, again promised a call back and again did not hear from them. A few days later I called again and got the regional manager again who promised a call back, but still did not call. a few days later I eventually got the cheque refund through. The tyres themselves are good, but the company who represents you for fitting is by far one of the worse and clearly try to take advantage of people who they think know nothing about cars. Thankfully although my husband doesn't I do, it is disgusting that they tried to take advantage and over charge people. So for that reason whilst I may still recommend [REDACTED] for tyres I would be very, very, very careful about who fits mine in the future and advise anyone else to be too."
The only way to get a great tyre service. Great price and great speedy service at a good tyre fitters.
Convenient fitting times. Good choice of tyres at affordable prices. First class service from the chosen garage.
Fitting was done efficiently and service was excellent. Only 4stars as original fitting date wasn't met as tyres couldn't be delivered on time. Will use [REDACTED] again but would always check competition pricing.
"Very good value, reasonably local fitment which was quickly done and was on my way. Nothing complicated at all"
Good tyres at a good price. Pleased
"Everything good. website easy to use, good prices, fitted on arrival at garage. Second time using [REDACTED], way to go"
"Book inappropriate appointments without checking with the customer, then send too many emails.If purchasing tyres book your own appointment with the garage.Tyres are cheaper than retailers prices."
Tyre Review. Excellent service and cheap tyres. Quick and easy to get my new tyres fitted
Not a great experience. Ordered to get fitted and a garage and the fitting got cancelled and rearranged four times. Not good when you have a temporary tyre on
Great price plus some extra discount when purchased. Fitting completed at a local garage within a couple of days. The whole process was hassle free.
When I arrived at my appointment 10 mins late I was told it would be another hour before the car would be looked at. I asked if I could come back in an hour and I was asked to come back in two hours.
"£300 for 4 x Michelin CrossClimate+ 205/55 R16 V (94) is a good price and it didn't take too long, as I was there early. It leaves me prepared for winter weather."
"Can’t fault the service . Buy and book on line . Turn up , tyres fitted , drive away . Guys at Silverburn more than helpful after I had made a backside of my order !"
"Good choice of tyres, good vfm."
Very easy to use and a large variety of choice
Very easy to choose the correct tyre and prices are very competitive.
Helpful quick and at very good prices
"As always; the right tyre, the right price and quick delivery"
Lots of choice to suit every budget and local fitting centres.
"Good efficient service, made things much easier using the mobile tyre service whilst on night shifts. Friendly and quick."
"Wide choice and competitive prices, quick turnaround and great customer service."
Very competent fitter and an efficient admin team
"So Easy and great value. Easy, quick, efficient with excellent choice of tyres from budget tyres and beyond. Excellent information regarding types i.e. road noise, best fuel economy etc. I couldn’t beat the price elsewhere. Go on line, choose your tyres, choose a garage and a fitting date, pay...job done! This is the third time I’ve used [REDACTED] - Excellent!"
"Tyres without TearsA simple ordering process and really keenly priced tyres. The fitting centre I used fantastic, the job done in no time really. I will be using them for non tyre related issues in the future."
"Great price, on holiday when I needed four tyres. Popped online and ordered tyres from local garage. Totally seamless transaction. Had a nice cup of coffee whilst tyres were fitted. Well done [REDACTED] and St Michaels garage, Swanage."
The garage in Accrington were really good
Very useful and easy way to purchase tyres
"Best value, guaranteed stock, guaranteed fitting time and no surprises when you pay."
Straight forward transaction and booking with the added bonus of a discount for buying two tyres
"It makes sense. This is the only on-line tyre supplier I have tried, but I found it so easy and convenient that I have now used them a few times. It works out cheaper and you can book a slot at your convenience (am or pm). Nothing to pay at the garage - the on-line payment is the total. A fair choice of tyres with no hidden costs -Why would you not use this service?"
"Excellent choice, pricing and fitting optionsWould definitely recommend using [REDACTED], I have used them twice in a week now for both sets of front and back tyres. Choice of tyres in terms of brand and pricing options is excellent along with a fitting option that included my local garage only a couple of hundred yards away. Perfect all round."
Simple to use and quite a lot cheaper than going direct to tyre centres. What's not to like?
"New wheels. Ordered new wheels for fitting, came quickly and fitted in a very short space of time. Excellent service"
Your agent fitted a faulty valve so I had to return the next day to get it sorted. I accept this can happen but they reversed my car into a wall. When I noticed they claimed that they didn't realize that they had hit it. Hard to believe due to the force needed to cause the amount of damage.They paid for the repair but I was without my car for 3 days.
Great prices and really prompt fitting. Saved nearly £200 on 2 tyres and got them fitted at a local garage at a really convenient time. The garage fitting them gave me a time slot and stuck to it - done and away in 30 minutes.
You changed my appointment twice. The point of booking online is convenience of time. I’m likely to go to a local garage next time.
Cheapest tyres and easy arrangements for fitting
"I booked an Am fitting, the fitter didn’t turn up until 2 o’clock and I had no communication whatsoever"
"Very few faults easy and convenient to use. The only fault I can come up with is they charge you extra to have the wheel tracking done, in my opinion this should come as standard when doing any changes to the wheels or tyres. Other than that can't fault it."
You have to try them at least once. Easy website for purchases. Multiple locations for fitting. A quick and easy way to get the tyres you need at great prices.
"easy to arranged, value for money"
It all worked well. The price was competitive and the fitting shop I was referred to did a great job.
"Priced around at my local tyre fitters, couldn’t get close to [REDACTED] prices. Booked a day and time to suit me for fitting and received a reminder on my phone, what more do you need, great service."
Always competitively priced and all details are taken care of without issue - why wouldn't I recommend a service like that??
Can’t fault the service and prices. Recommended.
Great quality and service.
"Best price, tyre fitted by local tyre dealer, would use again."
Hassle free and decent prices!
"Good price, great service"
An efficient cost effective service
"Over 5 years of loyalty for a reason. Been a user of [REDACTED] for well over 5 years, each and every time they have proven themselves with great tyre choices, competitive prices and availability. There are always a wide variety of fitting locations to choose from and brilliant turnaround times from all the fitting stations I've been too. Will keep coming back!"
"Good service from [REDACTED], but not happy with the service from the tyre fitting company"
Easy to choose tyres and find a garage. Didn’t get a 10 as some garages charge extra to align new tyres they were fitting.
"Exceptional Quality of product and service. For the past couple of years now, whenever I require tyres for my vehicles, [REDACTED].com is where I head straight to. When comparing their prices to other companies, they always comes out on top and there is never any fuss with finding a garage close by my address to fit them. [REDACTED].com offers value and exceptional quality of service. I have recommended them to friends and family."
easy to book appointment; good service; clean reception area and free coffee; polite staff; good price;
The experience I had with the garage was not pleasant experiences as they have damaged my alloys
Bad experience. Took my car to ATS on a Thursday for my tyres to be changed after waiting from 10.30 until 2.30pm then said they couldn’t do it! I called [REDACTED] and they said that ATS didn’t have the tyres although ATS said they did! I then asked to reschedule for the Friday and they couldn’t book me until the Monday so I cancelled them! Had to then call [REDACTED] a week later as still no refund! On the second call they said they had no record of me cancelling! Very disappointed
"Great price and great service, very easy to book and have the work carried out"
Good prices and a large choice of fitting stations
Found a great local garage that I never knew was there. I now have an alternative to the dreadful main stream tyre brands that monopolies our town!
"It didn't start off well as I had booked a date and time to have the tyres fitted, but on arriving for the fitting the garage had me booked in an hour later so we went for a coffee and returned only to be told that the tyres hadn't arrived! We went home and phoned [REDACTED] who accepted full responsibility and gave me a refund, a new date and time was arranged and everything went smoothly.I am now very pleased with my purchase and will be using them again."
Didnt get tyres I was expecting. These were cheap and easy to book for fitting but I was disappointed to discover that [REDACTED] isn’t a brand and that they just give you whatever budget tyre they have in stock. I liked the ratings on the tyre advertised but these didn’t match with what I got. This matters to me when it comes to buying tyres so I probably won’t use [REDACTED] again
"Excellent idea, what's not to like. You get the price before you get them fitted and then arrange to have the tyres fitted locally. Great service and very easy to use."
"It is a very easy way to buy tyres and ATS Stafford were excellent, I recommend [REDACTED] to all of my friends"
Good info price and local fitting Excellent.
Convenient and competitive prices
"Excellent services, the job got completed while I was working no time spend waiting around and he did a first class job no marks on my alloys. Couldn't have asked for a better job!"
"Excellent customer service, great job done !!"
"[REDACTED]com highly recommended. [REDACTED].com are to be recommended for their simplicity in providing a very cost effective, and efficient service with minimum fuss. The fitting service provided was absolutely first class. I have no problem in recommending both them and Spencers MOT & Service Centre Rackheath Norwich.It was a pleasure to do business with them both."
ease of access and good information
Very easy to use website. Competative prices
"Excellent value for money ,big saving over other companies.Quick efficient local fitting service"
Excellent choice of tyres at an attractive price. Easy to use website which offered fitment at several local garages. The garage I used were friendly and knowledgeable and I would not hesitate to go there again.
"After booking the car in, I called the garage 2 days later to book an mot, only to find out it wasn’t even booked in for the tyres. After having to contact you myself, then booking with another garage, they were delayed!"
great service and price and use local garages
Got the tyres I booked at a good price and fitted hassle free.
Competitive prices and prices shown include fitting and delivery to my local garage.
"Excellent service and price and very promt, what more is there to say."
Good price quick delivery good choice of fitters.
Choosing the right tyres at the right price online was quick and easy. Good number of garages do the fitting and an excellent job done.
"Very good price, excellent tyre fitting centre."
"Best price I could find, simple booking system and work carried at a convenient, reputable tyre specialist."
"The experience was easy and the fitter was very helpful, friendly and overall great value for money."
"Mobile fitter was excellent and tyres were at best price, recommended to friends."
Best way to buy tyres. Simple ordering experience that gave me a good choice. Selected a local garage for fitting. Like the way I can select from a wide range of tyres and then get them fitted at a time of my choice.
Arrived quickly and fitted well
Good choice; great price.
I have used [REDACTED] for a good couple of years now and always had a hassle free good deal weather I've gone to a garage or the mobile fitter has come to me I wouldn't go anywhere else
Great service with convenience of buying the tyres online and then choosing a local tyre centre for fitting. Prices are also competitive.
"Received an email from [REDACTED] just after 5;30pm the day before the fitting stating that the tyres hadn't been delivered. This gave me no opportunity to cancel the order that day and left me fretting as i was going on a driving holiday the next day. As it happened the email was in error as the tyres actually had been delivered, just not signed for. I was still unnecessarily stressed though and therefore only 7/10 despite the god price"
"Good value tyres poor communication. The tyres were good value and the fitters were excellent though communication from [REDACTED] was poor the fitting date and time was changed from the time sent in earlier communications but no one advised me, I arrived at the specified time only to be told that the fitting time had changed to the following day, wasting an hour of my time."
"Good price and website etc. But I chose a 9am Saturday slot. Was e-mailed to say it was moved to 12, which is fine. I could drop it off. But on arrival, the garage had no booking at either time. Luckily they fit me in!"
They put my tyre on the wrong way round. Luckily I had an MOT a few days later and it failed. Else I would not have known
Very good service. Fairly good price. Kept me informed at every stage. Tyres fitted locally. Pleasant staff.
Excellent value for money and the fitting service at Lakeside in Essex is so efficient I was in and out in 10 minutes!
"Very easy. Booked online, chose a date for fitting at my local autocentre and all was sorted when I got there. Easy experience all round."
Excellent website and great prices. Excellent website. So easy to use and the prices are fantastic. Would definitely recommend!!
"Easy transaction, local garage. Good value."
"Great service, value for money and will definitely use again"
"Extremely easy to use, details of tyre ratings so you can make an informed decision on what tyres suit your needs & booking ensures you get the tyre of choice rather than what the garage has in stock or promoting at the time"
I was disappointed to find you just get whatever tyres you have in stock. The picture and review I bought on the basis of appealed to me a lot more than the tyres o ended up with
Easy to find good tires and decide when and where to fit them.
"Excellent service from [REDACTED], as this is the third time I've used them! However, a bit disappointed with the local fitter, as despite removing the wheel centre caps and the locking wheel nut covers, (in the pouring rain), they didn't offer me the same courtesy and I ended up refitting them, (again in the pouring rain!). Other than that, a good experience!"
Very good service and prompt fitting.
Valves extraU said all inclusive
Great value for money. Very efficient service.
All round excellent. Website was user friendly and had loads of options. Lots of specials around if you buying 4 tyres. Mobile fitter came to our house and was professional and did a great job. The convenience of the mobile fitter was amazing. No more waiting for hours at a garage. Will definitely be purchasing all my tyres from [REDACTED] from now on.
Great service and [REDACTED]'s link with their partner garages.
Ease of use. Good selection. Local fitting arrangements. No hassle. Excellent service.
Well I ordered the tyres online. They were delivered to my chosen garage for fitting & everything was just brilliant.
Good value. Efficient booking system. Professional fitting.
You re-arranged an appointment for 2 days after the original appointment.
"Hassle free tyre fitting. Chose my tyres and then fitting date and location, tyres were at chosen garage and were fitted no problems."
Easy to use and order good prices
"Helpful, pleasant, staff - would recommend using this garage."
Cos it took nurlly 2 hours to change two tyers ........
Excellent value and informative staff
Excellent price on OEM Audi tyres
"good price, good website (although i initially ordered wrong tyres!), customer service via phone was excellent when i had to re-order the correct tyres"
"Cheap prices, prompt and courteous fitting."
"Happy customer. Good tyres, excellent price, hassle free service."
Simple easy and cheaper then local garages
Great tyresGreat priceGreat fitter !Would recommend.
Consistently the cheapest place to buy premium tyres. Seamless service from ordering through to fitting.
Excellent service from Wincanton Motor Sport (the tyre fitter) at a very competitve price. Thank you.
"Excellent prices using local firms, brilliant idea."
Easy to use. Easy to arrange fitting. Good prices
"Price for tyres was good. The garage that fitted them (Lewis motors) were excellent, friendly ,professional and prompt. Would use again certainly."
"Ease of use, price and choice of local fitters."
"After some teething issues (tyres sent to wrong fitter) the tyres were with the correct people by the next day and fitted at my place of work.Fitter was excellent, very friendly and efficient. Fitted my four tyres in the absolutely pouring rain.Great value and service."
Told by my garage that they could not buy-in the tyres at the price quoted therefore must be a good price.
Great value and excellent service. I run two family cars and you have supplied all my tyres in the last six years your business model works perfectly for me. Thank you. Alan Steel
apart from the shop where it was fitted not replying to [REDACTED] asking them to book a time. So `i had to rearrange the initial booking. BC were great in sorting it out.
Had a slight problem with the tyre size. Contacted [REDACTED] who sent a replacement without any trouble. all done within a week.
"Fitting was very efficient, after a delay in delivery"
"I ordered two tyres , when I dropped the car off and it was taken into the garage to be fitted I was told later that only one Tyre had arrived. I had to then leave and arrange another time for fitting that took time out of my weekend plans. I don't understand why they could not have informed me by text or email only one Tyre had arrived at the garage saving me time."
First class service and great choice and prices
"Excellent service, excellent price, prompt, polite, efficient!"
Very good service From call the help line to having the tyres fitted
Turned up as arranged and did exactly what I requested.
Good service and a good price
"Very easy to use online, especially for someone who doesn't know anything about cars or tyres. Also [REDACTED] was the only place I could find the particular type of tyre I needed. Price was competitive."
"Good price, local dealers"
Highly recommended. We have used [REDACTED].com many times and have always received a reliable service at an excellent price. The website is easy to navigate and book your fitting at your preferred garage.The choice of tyres is vast and the information provided helps you choose the right tyre for your needs and budget.
Ordering online easy; fitting took a long time.
"First class service first class prices, very easy to use website. Used tyresmart at witham essex to have them delivered and fitted. Very helpful fitting service top class. We all done to you all"
The website is easy to navigate and book the fitting. There are lots of tyres to choose from and the information provided about each different tyre helps with choosing the right one for your budget and preference (economy or performance).
"The website was easy to use, delivery was very quick and booking the fitting appointment worked perfectly. The company that fitted the tyres was very good."
Everything worked as was promised . Cheerful mechanics and staff in general . Job seems fine .
Easy. Straight forward. Good price.
"Good tyres, good price and excellent service at the garage for the fitting."
"Found the tyres at a reduced price than local outlets. Great all round and inclusive price, fitting, balancing and disposal of old tyres. Fitted at a location convenient to me. Will use again."
"10 out of 10 for the garage 0 out of 10 for [REDACTED] customer service. Booked and appointment online and received an email a day later stating my preferred slot wasn't available with an alternative suggested. The instructions in the email stated to 'reply to this email' to confirm if the new slot is acceptable and I did. I received no further response.A few days later I tried to follow up via email to see if my new appointment was actually booked. No response.I showed up to the garage on at my new time slot and was not surprised to find out that they didn't have my work scheduled. The garage (HQ Garage in Dalgety Bay) were awesome and fit my new tires despite having rejected the initial work request that came via [REDACTED].In short, [REDACTED] customer service didn't bother to confirm my time and the garage had to clean up after their mess. Terrible customer service from [REDACTED], excellent service from the garage."
"Absolute nightmare of a service DO NOT USE. Absolute nightmare of a service. Went to the so called ‘pit stop’ hoping it will be a quick and seamless service. Instead I was given a lecture, person was incompetent filling in the work order sheet and when I demanded names for complaint purpose, they were reluctant. Never using [REDACTED] again."
Good premium tyres at a good price
"[REDACTED] are brilliant! Great VFM.However, the garage that I used wasn't great at all. I am a disabled driver, there was no seat area available, so I stood around or sat on a wall of a neighbouring property. The task took 1.25hrs to replace 2 tyres. I don't think that's very good, do you?"
It was quick and easy to sort online out of normal working hours to allow fitting at a suitable time. The fitting was local and service there was much better than when I have been as a customer not having used [REDACTED].
"Cuts down the time looking at various retailers, tyres quoted for are a good quality, not major brands at an excellent price, low road noise and good in the wet.And all 4 were fitted within 40 minutes of the time quoted. Excellent service"
Fitting cancelled twice the night before as tyres out of stock! No alternative suggested there was poor communication when I called. Ie was told they would call back if new fitting time was available - didn’t hear back 🙈1 lady did give me £20 refund and was very efficient & eventually sorted the delivery of my tyres.
Would have been 10 but we were let down ay 5.15pm the afternoon before the fit by an email cancelling the fit because the tyres had not arrived at the fitting centre. I telephone [REDACTED] at 8.45am the next day and a very helpful lady telephoned the fitting centre and rang me back to say they had now arrived and to head up there. Waited 90 minutes before they began fitting and was there two and a half hours. (4 x tyres and alignment.)
The process of ordering was fine but the end result of over forcing extra sales and over charging at the garage was disappointing.
"Was easy to order but even though I was able order tyres for different vehicles I wasn't able to book 2 vehicles in to have them fitted. Fortunately I knew the garage owner and her was able to sort it out for me, otherwise there would have been a lot of confusion. Also tyres were delivered on different days so wasn't able to get tyres both cars on the same day."
Best Value. The service is just so convenient. I did find slightly cheaper prices but they came with a longer wait time and from a brand that I'm not familiar with.
Price. Speed of fitting. Time to suit me.
"Ever since I was introduced to [REDACTED] I have never used any other place for tyres. Excellent service, excellent quality tyres at excellent prices"
Excellent service from a local garage . Tyres fitted quickly
Good price for tyres.
Very easily organised through the website at reasonable prices. Great getting them fitted at a time that suits you at a local garage
"Tyres at best price delivered to Abbey Tyres, Hound, an independent business that provided excellent service."
Cheap prices and as long as you choose a good garage then good all round service.
"Easy web page , good prices , fast service"
Definitely use [REDACTED]com again. Will definitely be using [REDACTED].com in the future. Very competitive prices and the option to have the mechanic come out to you to fit tyres. Ordering online was quick and easy and my tyres were fitted at home a couple of days after ordered. Definitely recommend!
"Very easy to use from start to,finish. Couldn’t get tyres fitted on first date I picked but they managed to set it up for another convenient time for me"
A genuine good service that gives me the choice of tyres at a good price with an allocated time slot to suit me. Ideal
Good price.
Not always my best option due to location.
Always the best price without having to haggle. Can find a local garage which is convenient
Excellent service great price could not fault it
"Everything the present day consumer expects. Swift, painless and economic. Everything the present day consumer asks for. I chose my local ATS garage for location rather than anything else, but that was also a great experience. My tyres were removed, shifted to the rear and new tyres fitted within about 40 minutes, which included completing paperwork, having a coffee, checking my emails and chatting to the knowledgable and really friendly and professional service advisors. A genuine top drawer experience. And of course the price and choice of tyres was the key to my decision for choosing [REDACTED]."
"Great all round service. Lots of choice to suit your price range, simple online ordering process and excellent fitting service. I've used [REDACTED] twice now and certainly will again."
booked to have 2 tyres fitted confirmed booking then was told that the garage didnt have the right equipment for a 19 inch wheel worse excuse i have ever heard then booked it into another garage saturday who then couldnt fit 2 tyres due to 2 being run flats so ordered another 2 for a thursday fitting then received a e-mail wedsenday night at 17.27 saying that they cant fit the tyres with no time left to call you as you closed at 17.30 surly a phone call would have been better as i had taken the day off work to arrange this then after a call to yourselfs they infact did have the tyres but if i never chased it up in the morning i would have lost another 3/4 days so took almost 2 weeks to get a set of tyres fitted so i wont be using your service again and im afaid i wont be recomending your service
Tyres for Renault Master. Great choice of tyres to choose from. Clear information to be able to make a decision on which tyre was best for my purpose. Booked in for two new tyres at local fitter no problems.
"All good in the end. Tyres were at the garage, ready and on-time. I did actually have a problem with the garage that fitted my tyres, but [REDACTED] were brilliant at getting it resolved."
"Good value would use again. Initial late cancellation of my first appointment due to tyres not delivered on time. However, good customer service thereafter, easy, convenient re-book and tyres fitted with a minimum of fuss. Great price too."
"Everything worked, my order was ready, I did not have to wait, people were knowledge, polite and helpful. The garage was clean and tidy"
Convenient and simple with a discount against the price that I was quoted by visiting a tyre fitting garage
"Well I chose Laws Tyres to fit my tyres. They came back with recommendations of new valves (the 2 of them were £70), I went for this but I did wonder if this a bit steep. They also offered me wheel alignment at £120....I did not go for this, and I thought this was very expensive."
"good price, delivery as promised, efficient fitting partner"
"Easy process to arrange new tyres, pay and choose where to be delivered to"
Very effective and cheaper than the nearest competitor
Efficient and well priced service.
Easy to find tyres online . N Reasonable price and the ATS garage guys in Peyerborough (Dave and Mark) were so very helpful.
Easy to use website and saved money.
Excellent service and great price.
"[REDACTED] cant fault them. What can I say, great experience from [REDACTED] all round. Even offered to fit my tyres a day earlier but sadly the car wasn’t available.Called the night before to arrange the time of visit, arrived on time the following morning, nice chap, very professional and fitted my tyres with no problems. Will use [REDACTED] for all my tyres from now on and I will recommend your service to anyone I know wanting new tyres. Thankyou."
"Great service especially with the garage fitting them. Everything went as planned and the correct Jaguar marked tyres were delivered. Garage where they were fitted (Autotec Scotland) were fantastic as always, started the job bang on time and used their Road Force Balancing machine (only place in Scotland who have them) to make sure all four wheels were perfectly balanced."
Always the best prices. I purchased British made Avon tyres which give a better ride and quieter than the Continental tyres they replaced at a much lower price.
"Good price and range of products easy to arrange fitting at local garage polite, friendly service at local garage"
Flexible and helpful customer service- both online and at our local centre
"K R Motors Chilcompton Excellent. Excellent service, great price and work done without waiting."
"Not enough choice - only 1 tyre precisely matched my requirements and there should be more options than that. Also, the garages you partner with has considerably reduced since my last purchase, and the only really convenient 1 by distance was quite rude to me last time I went there."
Nice easy transaction at a good price.
"A pain free experience. Ordered tyres on line, turned up at designated time and hey presto tyres fitted. No problems since. And a good price on the tyres!"
"quick, easy, good price and good fitters"
"My fitting date changed after i made other arrangments then 1 tyre had been stored and flattened so couldnt be fitted, I had to wait a full week for a replacement and then easte my time and fuel going back to tyre fitter. I suggested in an E Mail that some kind of compensation should be given to which i never recieved an E Mail in reply, in otherwords jist ignored."
"I have found the same tyre on a different site cheeper and I contacted your team to see if they can mach prices, the answer was no and 2 days later you had Bridgestone and Michelin on offer."
"good reputation, good prices"
Every thing went very smoothly and at a great price.
"Everything with service from [REDACTED] was ok but my initial booking was cancelled at my preferred garage, rearranged booking was ok but after being informed that my original garage was unavailable I went back into [REDACTED] and the garage was still available for selection on the morning of my booking. If a garage is unavailable surely it shouldn’t be there for selection, my rearranged appointment was ok for me but wouldn’t necessarily be ok for someone else"
Why do it any other way. You get to chose the tires and pick what garage you want at a time that suits you. The only time this service doesn't work is if you need to replace a tire due to a puncture or damage. A great service and very easy and if you have any issues communication from [REDACTED] is easy. Even the garages don't mind you using them. Thanks for the service
"It was so easy to order on line, and had a choice of garages to choose from."
"Purchased a full set of Michelin Energy savers at the best price I could find and had them fitted at ATS which was done perfectly and quickly. Good service, will definitely look to use again providing the price is right!"
"Very good experience, I was able to picked two good tyres and I was very happy with the people who fitted them at a time of my convenience. Wasn't booked in on the garage's system but once they found my order on [REDACTED]' system, there wasn't a problem."
The fitting centre I Felt as though they were pushing me to get extra work and ended up getting wheel alignment done
The garage i went to
Will use [REDACTED] again. I will never go to a F1 garage again as their service was the worst I had ever received
"Good value, trouble free service. Ordered my tyres, chose the garage date and time. Turned up. Friendly guy. Fitted on time. Sorted.Well done [REDACTED] and Express Garage in Walton on Thames ;)"
"Easy to order online and book a slot. Good price, convenient location. Guys doing the work were very polite and kept me informed."
Superb level of customer service from check-in to completion
Best value after checking many tyre companies on the web. Service at ATS was speedy and friendly
Excellent value. Good range of local fitters
Super price and service would definitely recommend and use again
"Excellent service, website easy to use, prices for tyres are very competitive and easy to arrange fitting locally. Cant fault this company"
Best prices. Simple webpage for ordering.
Was a quick and easy process and products are very affordable compared to other places.
"Good price, fast delivery and fitment at a local garage"
Great service. They strangled the booking with my local garage with ease. I would absolutely recommend them without a doubt!!
"Great Price Great Choices of Tyres Brands. Great prices, Easy to use, Great choice of tyres and brands."
Easy to search for correct sized tyres and shop for a good all inclusive price. Arranging fitting and appointment was also straightforward.
"Booked and payed for 2 tyres, selected a date and time that was available (according to the website). Then got an email saying that date and time wasn’t available and that I’d have to rebook. Requested a new time via email the same day. Got no response to emails for 3 days. Rang customer service, got told they’d call me back - never did. I called again a day later, trying to sort out the booking (by this point you’d already had my money for several days without any confirmed booking). The booking was finally confirmed over the phone. Then the email confirmation was not correct based on the information received over the phone. Finally got the booking sorted after MORE emails. Definitely wouldn’t use again."
Quality tyres at a good price and professionally fitted
Agreat site and reliable trades peope
"I looked at the [REDACTED] website and it seemed ideal - very competitive price , very local fitting and appeared that I could get my tyre replaced very quickly.I'd got a puncture on Saturday night so on Monday i tried to ge ta new tyre - the [REDACTED] website said first available date wednesday -i thought this was reasonable as i have had difficulty sourcing tyres before - I picked a very local garage and it came up with virtually every time slot available - I picked one and received an email with booking reference etc.... I assumed this meant it was booked.The next day I received an email and text saying to contact [REDACTED] urgently - which I did - I was told I couldn't have the appointment I had booked and on asking for an alternative appointment that day I was told there were NONE available - they were fully booked. I asked why I had received an email and was told that isn't a confirmation!I was then told I could have an appointment on Thurs at ANY time - I opted for 11:00am although I could have done any time... I was contacted about 10mins later to be told there were NO appointments for the WHOLE of thursday... why offer me any time iwanted if i wasn't able to get any appointment ??By this time I just wished I'd never paid for the tyre and had tried elsewhere - I was then told I could have any time Friday!! I said I was working on Friday and wouldn't be able to ge tto the garage until 15:30....they shut at 16.00! ...but I was told I could have that time.I arrived at the garage early and they said they could do my tyre now...but when they went to look they said they didn't think the tyre had come as there was nothing in my name...As I was about to explode they said they had a tyre not in my name that they could fit now.After explaining my frustrating experience to the guy in the garage he said if i'd called them directly on Monday - they could have done it that afternoon!!!!... although they probably couldn't compete with the price - he looked for me and it would have cost £6 more!!! I probably would have paid £40 more!! NOT because i wanted to but for the convenience and lack of stress i had to endure dealing with [REDACTED].If in the beginning I'd been told i couldn't have it done until Friday i would have been frustrated but it would have been my choice wether i continued with the purchase or went elsewhere - but to be mucked about and having to reschedule appointments etc....i DEFINITELY will NOT be using them again or be recommending them to anyone else"
"Excellent service. I needed to change the fitting date and a quick call and it was all sorted and confirmed with an email. Fitting was done on time, price was competitive. Thank you. Will definitely use you again and have recommended to friend at work"
"Good morning Mr Mellor. Selecting the tyres, fitting garage and paying couldn’t be simpler. There was a day’s delay in delivery but this was promptly and efficiently advised, so no complaints. I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by name at the garage who were also quick doing the work; I was out of there in under 30 minutes. I’ll be back when I need to change the rears."
Great tyres. It was an easy transaction and we had good communication throughout . Unfortunately the garage needed to change my fitting date but it was easily sorted. I couldn’t have got a better deal on my tyres!
"Great tyres, much improved steering feel over the old, (and admittedly), well worn Yokohama’s.Just what you would expect from Michelin.(Porsche Cayenne)."
All worked like clockwork. I wanted a decent set of cross climate tyres at the most competitive price and that is what I got. Arranging fitting at a local dealer went like clockwork too. Great value and simple to use. What is there not to like?
I always use [REDACTED] for my car tyres. Its so easy to arrange an appointment at my chosen garage and there is no pressure selling.
I find it easy to use and find suitable tyres at a reasonable price. I also like to compare the characteristics and prices of all your tyres on your website.
Appointment booking for a Saturday showed as available. When the garage isn’t open on Saturday. Causing a weeks delay and be sent to a different garage.
"I was able to purchase the tyres I wanted at a very reasonable price, I then loved that I could book a garage near to me to fit them where I could read previous customer feedback to ensure I choose the best and they were great!"
Easy to purchase. Reasonable value for money. Able to book a fitting slot. Mobile fitter was excellent.
"Original fitting day was cancelled. Subsequently contacted [REDACTED] and arranged new fitting day. Queried with [REDACTED] why there was no time on the confirmation email and was told it was a first come first served basis. On arriving at the fitting centre they had no record of this new booking and said that they didn't have a tyre fitter in that day so couldn't fit my tyres. Rebooked directly with them for Monday 12th at 9am. Turned up promptly and it still took an hour and 15mins for my tyres to be done. Email thread below. Your request has been updated. To add additional comments, reply to this email. Vishnu, Aug 1, 09:53 BST: Dear Martin, Thank you for your email. The garage works on first come first serve basis so you can visit the garage anytime between 09:00 - 11:30 for AM appointment. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

"Excellent service throughout. Professional and obliging. Super product, fitted at a very reasonable price. Difficult to beat [REDACTED], based on my experience I would not hesitate to recommend, and use again. Could not be faulted."
"Winwin. Great value tyres, speedy fitting, fitting fee going to local independent shop."
Good price and the service worked dont call the company you will be robbed. Good price and the service worked. However the online credit card transaction defaulted after my card was approved which meant I had to call [REDACTED] on their customer service number. I did not realise that this was a premium number and although I was eventually connected we easily resolved payment. Following the call I received a message from my mobile phone provider telling me that the call cost over £30...ironically the call was a Wi-fi call so ordinarily would not cost anything thing. All of my savings were absorbed by this phone call! I am very unhappy and feel that I have been duped.
Price was good but I arrived at the garage and the tyres were not there...I had to do all of the chasing and create the solution...no apology from [REDACTED].
Very easy to use website. Choice of garages to use all very credible. Reccomend
"Very easy to book and compare tyres, no problems until my time slot was changed, when I got to the fitting centre they were not made aware of my booking including the type of tyres booked and vehicle or my appointment time however they were brilliant and able to fit me it anyway"
"While the fitting team damaged my car, I appreciate that they are nothing to do with [REDACTED] and the support you gave me afterwards was fantastic. Great customer service"
Eventually got 3td choice tyres due ordering specific tyres and then twice being told yo haven't got them. First delivery to garage got lost
"Easy to order. Price most competitive. Used a fitter local to my holiday accommodation and they were punctual, polite and efficient."
"Great service, great staff but app only allows am/pm. 1hour to fit 2 tyres was a little on the long side"
"Cornish holiday not spoiled by my damaged tyre. Had a problem with a tyre splitting along the tread so even though I was on holiday I felt it needed to be changed. Used [REDACTED] because the fitting company was closest to my holiday address. Prices were very good and they offered a discount for 2 tyres so went for that. I checked that the fitter had received the tyres before I drove over. Communications were excellent. Ordering was really easy, and the tyres were delivered in good time. Garage provided a tyre fitting report showing all the job details. They also provided me with a brake inspection report. Nothing to find fault with."
Easy Process. Easy to orderGood pricesAll went easy at garageWould recommend
"Frankly all a bit of a muddle. Lots of emails and texts confirming this that and the other, half of which was relating to things that had changed. Phone calls with the fitters who initially said they knew nothing of the appointment, then a changed appointment, then two appointments the same day but six hours apart; all a bit of a pickle. Thankfully only one appointment was required to fit all four tyres (They were expecting me to be bringing two different cars for some reason) but only the inner part of the valves were changed because the outers were out of stock which I only found out about when I went back to complain about the balancing not being correct. Everyone involved was very nice, the whole experience was just a muddle and could have been so much better. Left feeling quite disappointed and messed around by the whole experience."
"Great value, easy to use.... there was an unavoidable problem on sourcing the tyres so had to change appointment.... the way [REDACTED] handled this was very efficient and effective... fitting service organised by [REDACTED] was excellent - convenient, very modern facility"
First time using [REDACTED] and can honestly say it was an easy way to say a few pounds on my new Michelin ps4's tyres for my BMW m140i.I saved £50 by ordering from here and still had them fitted next day by a local garage.
"Good service, fitting was at the same location that I have normally used direct."
Order quickly dispatched and selected garage very helpful
Excellent service. Polite and courteous staff. Quick and efficient would definitely use again.
"Excellent Customer Service. Needed 5 new tyres for my car, luckily on the day I ordered there was a 10% discount, saved me £110. Later there was a problem with the fitting time, customer services re-arranged the time seamlessly and kept me informed through the whole process.The garage fitted the tyres without a problem."
"the guy who changed the tires was spot on, the issue that I had was that I booked an AM time slot for this and the engineer didn't arrive until 3pm. I wasn't even advised that he was running late."
"At your expense and loss. I buy the best of the best after researching what I’m buying, so I’m confident in what I’m paying for, I got two Perelli grade A tyres from here and fitting arranged a ford custom 2015 high spec.A free winter check was offered i accepted, a week after my tyre fitting and winter check my van over heats, turned out a mechanic left the expansion tank cap off resulting in a catastrophic engine failure three weeks on I’m still trying to get this company to get my van a detailed diagnosis let alone to fix the problem, was offered to take it back to the tyre garage that create this problem to look at But they are not specialists in engine management let alone poor competence to do a winter check."
Quick and efficient. I chose the pilot sport 4 tyres for my Audi S3. The fitter cost £6 to come or my house which is absolutely nothing! Excellent service I will be using [REDACTED] again! So much cheaper than garages!
"The buying experience was good however the morning appointment for the tyre fitting that I specified was not honoured. I dropped my vehicle off at Protyre, Carterton just after opening and it was not ready to collect until after two o clock. All that was provided by Protyre were excuses, not a good experience and significantly delayed my plans for the afternoon."
Last minute change. Had a booking that was changed last minute (literally 4:15pm) the day before the tyre fitting was due.Complained about this as cause huge disruption to the following day and had a knock on effect as had to rebook in a reschedule work diary.Tyres now sorted however Very slow responses from the customer care team and still don’t know if they have fully resolved the issue.
"Recommended to use [REDACTED]. Price was competitive. Problem with delivery to chosen garage due to access caused a delay but refunded £20 as a consequence without asking for any compensation. Tyres fitted by Steve’s Autos, Lancing. Good man. Good job. Very efficient and polite. Would definitely use him again."
Whilst price is good the last 2 orders and fitments have been delayed and rebooked due to the tyres not arriving in time. Fortunately this wasnt an a issue but might have been if booked prior to a holiday or MOT test.
"Excellent in every respect. Excellent choices with good descriptions, user reviews and prices. Delivered as stated at time of ordering and great choice of fitting centres.Highly recommended!"
I ordered 2 tyres to be delivered to ATS Llanelli. After half an hour of dropping my car in the garage i received a phone call from ATS notifying ma that only 1 tyre had been delivered and that was the wrong tyre!
"Quick and easy service to use, good variety of selected garages to choose from. There was a delay in my tyre delivery; this was communicated to me effectively and rescheduled with no issues. The service from the selected garage was good and I saved money using [REDACTED]."
"Could not get through to an agent by phone at all, but I was able to manage the fitting time by e-mail"
Very impressed with the prices and the service. Cant be faulted! Well done; keep it up! Will definitely buy from you again.
"The worst communication. To say i had a terrible customer experience is and understatement. To start off this terrible experience I had booked an AM fitting and there was no sign of the driver by 13:00 so i attempted to call [REDACTED] and was on hold for over 25 minutes. I didnt have anymore time to spend on the phone so i tried to send them and email asking whether or not the driver was going to turn up at all forgetting the AM fitting like i had booked (bearing in mind it is now 13:25 and still no tyres fitted). Not only did i not receive an email back with any information on the drivers where-abouts, i still haven't had an email back from them regarding the whole situation or apology!"
"Great, polite service at garage and great price for tyres."
Good price and service
Purchasing tyres was easy. Getting them fitted was a complete nightmare.- 14/08. Arrived at 7.45am for an 8am fitting. I left the garage at 11am. I complained at the timeabout the time it took took replace the 4 tyres. - 15/08. Started vehicle at 7.30am to drive to work. Tyre pressure warning light came on so checked tyres. Rear driver side tyre low as tyre was leaking air. Also noticed the tyre fitters had damaged wheels. Had to drive to the fitters to sort out air leak and complained about fresh damage to wheels. Took abou half for them to sort wheels and decided I would complain in writing rather than confront the fitters as at the time I was and am fuming. - 15/08. MOT booked in with BMW. Car passed MOT. However I was advised that the front brake pad warning wire was hanging. Had to book car in again on the 18/08 to be rectified.19/08. BMW checked the front brake pad warning wire. Brake Pads and discs replaced by BMW in March and was advised by BMW that the front brake pad warning compartment was cracked and the wire left hanging when the tyres were changed.Im not one to complain. However all the above are unacceptable.I will be pursuing this......
"Very good prices and fitted at local garage. After my first journey I had a flat tyre, took vehicle back to fitter who said puncture that cannot be repaired. After much mumbling to myself rang [REDACTED] to order another tyre and was told I was covered by lifetime guarantee on that tyre and replaced FOC. I was surprised and delighted and will definitely use again and recommend."
"Nothing outstanding, marginally cheaper but had fitting delayed"
"The ATS in Aylesford were most efficient, polite and flexible. the tyres were fitted and put on the wheels I required."
"Wide selection of tyres at good prices, prompt and efficient service at our local Horsham Broadbridge Heath garage."
Good service at the best price
Very easy to select the correct tyres from your range. Would highly recommend your on-line services.
Polite quick and efficient service. Person who acted as the company representative was polite and helpful. I was met as I arrived and was dealt with straight away no waiting around. The premises were very basic but seemed to run efficiently - all seemed neat and tidy and will organised. I was near a large Tesco store so I was able to do some shopping as they got on with my tyres. I received a call on my mobile phone when the work was complete. I picked up my car straight away everything seemed in order. They could not give me the usual receipt but gave me a copy of the worksheet instead.
quite good but others are occasionally cheaper
i ordered my tyre and arranged a fitting date Monday 29 july i them got an email from you telling that my tyre has been delayed and not available until Tuesday 6th August i contacted the garage that was fitting the tyre to cancel my appointment only to be told they had the tyre delivered and could be fitted i have since had several emails from you to make a new time for fitting when it has already been done.
Price and ease of overall service
"Easy to use website, great price for the tyres that I wanted, delivered to my local tyre centre which made the process hassle free."
Fast easy service with great prices.
"Garage fitted tyres efficiently and in a short time, very pleased with the results."
"easy to use, not messing around with garages, you can pick your slot"
Superb and polite service from the garage. Reasonable price
I have used [REDACTED] before and been very happy but this time the Tyres were not delivered on time
Staff were helpful a d polite BUT first selection turned out not to be available after being told it was. Offered alternative but never arrived at garage. LOST. That tyre was then not available so onto third choice which were fitted OK.
"A bit of a mixed bag of goodbadgreat. A bit of a mixed bag in terms of overall experience I'm afraid, so lower rating than I anticipated. Finding and paying for the tires online, including the actual price for high grade Michelins, was all very good...things just fell apart after choosing the deliver and fit option to a local (big name) garage. Using the online booking too was a doddle but within 24hrs I had an email saying the time was no longer any good as the garage was fully booked. Then the customer service for alternative provision was basically picked for me from a few days/times I offered (a week later than my original slot mind you!). The worst part however was taking time of work to visit the garage only to be told 'they don't book tire fitting at their garage' and basically being told to wait in line for 45 mins behind the drive-in customers?! Bit pointless having a booking system and they fully blamed [REDACTED] for offering something online that well basically, wasn't offered in the real world. I have to say on the garage's part though they were excellent when I returned after about 40 mins and did the 2x tires very quickly and capably, so the eventual service was great. My tip then: ring the garage even if you book tires online with BC else you are wasting your time potentially!"
Excellent price and service from allocated dealer.
Tyres turned up on time and as described.
"Great Prices & Customer Service. Recommend both [REDACTED] and D&R motors. Left me lockable wheel nuts at garage, and [REDACTED] immediately contacted me to let me know. Would use again."
"Good web site, saved money and partner who fitted the tyres were quick and efficient"
Excellent service. Tyres arrived as promised and saved me money.
"Easy to place order, and arrange fitting"
"Used [REDACTED] twice, never again. Was supposed to be fitted on Wednesday got an email at 6:30pm Tuesday saying there was an issue and could not fit on Wednesday. Rang the garage who said two tyres were delivered they asked where the others were and was told that [REDACTED] only ordered two instead of four! Had to rearrange the rest of my week because of this."
"Initial tyre order was lost in the post on way to the fitting garage. I was informed the day before by email and text that there was a change to my order. No indication of what had changed, I read the new email and missed the date change.Wasted my time by going to the garage, who didn't have the tyres when I noticed the date change. I would recommend that they update the messages to state what has changed.I was called later in the afternoon, as there was no more stock of the tyres I had purchased and was offered a free upgrade to better tyres (£45 each x 2). The second visit and fitting went without any issues.Good customer service but I've removed one star just because of the issues faced (partly I know to my mistake) and the fact they need to let you know what has changed."
"Not a great Experience with [REDACTED].com on this occasion , Firstly the cancelled my original appointment at 3pm on the day before I was due to get my tyres fitted . they took upon themselves to move my appointment on 2 days after the original appointment . When I eventually got there after rearranging my schedule the person at the garage informed me that they had the tyres but my appointment had been cancelled and that I had to phone to confirm so they would get paid .the only reason they have 2 stars instead of one was that the garage I went to we really helpful ."
"[REDACTED] only delivered three tyres to the garage instead of four for the following day fitting which had to be cancelled. An MOT was also arranged to coincide with the fitting which had to be cancelled and rearranged. Unusually, as my wife is severely disabled and requires constant care, arrangements were made for her to be looked after at the day centre in Kirriemuir on the first date given. Consequently, similar arrangements had to be made on the actual day of the fitting. So in my case the late cancelation caused considerable problems."
"I had the garage all booked, tyres didn't arrive so had to rearrange the following week, then get told the garage couldn't fit me in for another 3 weeks, so had to go to a different garage further away."
Good tyre section easy to arrange a service garage with a good selection of slots to have the tyres changed at competitive prices.
Good price at a local service centre
Easy and cheaper
best prices at a local service centre
"Competative on price, quality product and delivered on time to the correct garage."
Easy to use reasonable prices.
Very easy to order and arrange tyre fitting. Excellent service - would highly recommend.
Good quality products at good competitive prices
Good prices but fitting garage didn't want to know when they knew the tyres were from yourselves
"Poor customer service. Well having used [REDACTED] before I opted to purchase some fully fitted tyres from them.Got the confirmation email and booking for fitting, so I took half day off work to allow, very late email arrives saying delay and so booking moved a day forward. So another half day booked and what another late email saying can’t actually get hold of tyres? I rang their customer services who had no sympathy at all for 2 half days being booked and they could offer me cheaper tyres at the same price of which I refused. I explained that my chosen tyres were still on sale on their website but for some reason were almost £20 more for each tyre, could this be the reason? Who knows, anyway I had to opt for different tyres to be fitted which meant another delay and more time off work. Also the tyres were cheaper and a refund is pending but nothing yet so I’ll have to contact them again 🙁"
"Im a happy repeat customer. I'm a repeat customer for great service and excellent value. The independent garage at Bolney Grange near Haywards Heath who fitted my first set of [REDACTED] tyres years ago, have been my garage for a number of years now. [REDACTED] website is the first place I look for tyres for my BMW Z4."
Tyre not available on first date booked had to rebook
"Disappointing for what use to be a great company. I have used [REDACTED] for 2 years. Slowly but surely the service has got poorer and poorer. No response from email queries. Dates for fitting are promised and then cancelled. Having finally decided to use ATS Tyres direct, who were actually cheaper, my refund has still not be received after two weeks. The work was subcontracted through ATS anyway. A real shame for what use to be a great business."
The mobile fitter damaged the underside of my car. Unlikely to recommend.
"Excellent supplier. An excellent tyre supplier. Have used BC before - they have an easy to use online tyre selector for my car, Offer a wide range of tyre choice across whole price range, Good price on the ones I wanted and plenty of information and reviews, delivered fine to my garage (where I also get car serviced and maintained!) .. fitted fine and couldn't ask for better service."
Delivery date was not met.
Best prices every time.
"Competitive prices on a good range of tyres, able to book appointment time that suited, good location and staff were efficient, polite and courteous and were able to answer all my questions about the condition of our tyres."
"Brilliant service from start to finish. This was so easy to do and I have already recommended to friends. Thanks [REDACTED] and Golden hill garage for excellent service,"
Very good tyres and friendly service.
They delivered the wrong tyres not even a close one. They brought tyres for a van. And i had to call them like 3 times to clear it is not my tyre. [REDACTED] support employee had no idea wha im talking about and cancelled my order to make a refund. I had to call him back that i want my tyre asap. Kam servicing in Beeston is 5 stars as they managed to help me out of this and rebook the appointment when they delivered finally the good tyres a couple of days later....
"Exceptional service. I bought a rear tyre for my mondeo. When I went for fitting it turned out that I'd chosen the wrong speed rating. I called [REDACTED] expecting the worst. To my complete surprise and, dare I say, joy.They arranged for this to be picked up and the correct one sent out. I will not hesitate to use [REDACTED] again. A great price, great service and nice people to boot. Thank you"
First time I have used [REDACTED] and never again. First they delivered one 18 inch & one 19 inch tyre instead of two 18's.Once this had been sorted out I went to get the tyres fitted and was appalled by the shabby condition of the tyres; they looked grey and old (but unused) not at all how new tyres normally look. Not surprising when I inspected the 'Dot Date' and it was 4517 (ie tyres manufactured in week 45 of 2017.Queried this with [REDACTED] who told me that they have many different suppliers and do not check the age of the tyres.They could re-order but no guarantee that the replacements would be any newer. Not at all happy and requested a refund which they say they will do.
Really great and easy experience. Has all the information I need to make a great choice. Getting tyres fitted was just as easy. Definitely will be a repeat customer.
"Good product and price, 1st choice fitting centre was unavailable, despite the time and day showing availability. [REDACTED], however managed to get me in to a different centre at short notice. Found their agents very helpful"
"good price, tyres waiting when arrived 4 done in under a hour"
easy & quick ordering process tyres fitted on time whilst saving money on purchase

Good choice of tyres at reasonable prices. Prompt & friendly service from firmest centre.

"great service, tyres arrived on time and were fitted quickly"
Excellent and highly professional!
Great value and service
Second time the appointment has been changed by yourselves. Still waiting on £10 credit
"You make the whole start to finish process of tyre replacement so easy. For the customer it starts by you offering a wide range of tyres at very good prices, along with enough information about the tyres for us to make an informedchoice. We choose and pay for the tyres, just one payment, no hidden extras. They are delivered to the our choice of fitting centres very quickly and a slot for fitting is booked. Your service really gives so much choice and control to the customer. For me there's no other way to replace my tyres."
4 x Avon tyres at a really good price and fitted at a really good garage 3 miles from home. I even got a free 'posh' coffee in their comfy air-conditioned cafe while I waited.
4 x Avon tyres at a really good price and fitted at a really good garage just 3 miles from my home. Even got a free 'posh' coffee while I waited in their comfy air-conditioned cafe.
"Great service, easy process from start to fitting! Will certainly use again in the future."
Process good. Shame fitters aren’t the same
"The tyre was good value for money and it was delivered promptly to the garage of my choice,this the first time I have ordered tyres but I will do so again."
"Tyres are good customer service and booking bad. Tyres are good, price is good. Customer service and booking have been terrible on this occasion. Booked to have the Tyres done at a local garage on Thursday, they tell me less than 24 hours before that they can't get the tyres there on time. They give me a new suggested date which I immediately told them was not suitable and suggested I can do today instead. Got no response back on this for another 48 hours, then get an email today telling me I can take it in today. Weekend plans ruined as a result of not having tyres ready."
First time using this service. [REDACTED] changed my appointment three times.
"straightforward to use, good prices, choice of fitting providers.Good overall experience."
"Work completed within the allotted time frame, friendly staff"
It is just so easy and hassle free. Straightforward tyre selection and payment and choosing a convenient garage to fit them is the icing on the cake.
Good prices on tyres and delivered as they said.
Very easy to order and book tyre fitting locally
Great service. Great prices. Cannot fault anything - I have already recommended to a friend who has purchased through you.
The service was excellent from ordering to fitting.
"Very easy to book, good prices, recommended"
"Excellent easy to use website, local well known garage fitted tyres and did excellent job. Overall very good experience will definitely use again and recommend to friends and family."
Quick and easy to order tyres and find a garage close to me for them to be delivered... Great quality and great prices
Quick value for money service
I have used [REDACTED] three times and each time elected to use my local fitting service garage which I also use for repairs & MOT. Price was very competative and the process was very smooth
Nice easy transaction. Good tyres and fitter was early and did a great job.
"SUPERB TO DEAL WITH. Superb to deal with, order your tyres, pay on line then turn up at your selected garage at. Your selected time, saved me a fortune,"
The tyres themselves were good but [REDACTED] told me a specific time and when I went to the garage they’d received the tyres but not been told who for or when. They said they couldn’t fit me in but eventually after an hour and half they did. It’s possible that it was the garages fault but they did say this has happened before. The price was good and they were put on but the communication wasn’t fantastic and I had a long wait despite being told a time- was it [REDACTED] or the garages fault?? I’d use them again despite the mixup for the price.
Very good but . [REDACTED] seem to provide an excellent service at a good price and easy to order online etc. The twice I have used them (maybe 2 years apart) I have ended up at the same garage for fitting (served by the same person) and there was a little bit of attitude because we didn't book direct with the garage. Otherwise all good.
No notice of being unable to fit tyres offered fitting five days later. Ordered a Tyre for my daughters car as existing tyre irreparable. As no spare until replaced could not drive car. Ordered on Weds for fitting Saturday morning. Received an e mail at 7.51 am about feedback and another at 7.52 stating that the tyre could not be fitted on Saturday and the earliest date for fitting would be five days later on Weds. During this time my daughter would have no driveable car. She needed the car on Saturday. This meant I had little chance of finding a local tyre fitter to fit a tyre on the busiest morning of the week and certainly not at a competitive price. Very poor service to be told just before fitting time the order could not be fulfilled. Ended up paying a premium to get a tyre fitted on the Saturday.
"Good service would recommend to friends. Booked through [REDACTED] to have two tyres replaced at local garage all arranged by [REDACTED] all details date, time and invoice emailed to me very efficient would recommend to family and friends."
Convenience. Alway use [REDACTED] now as they offer all the tyre choices I could want and to ability to choose when and where they are fitted is a major plus for me.
"Customer journey was great from start to finish,no fuss and prices very competitive.Job done."
"As expected, good price for top range tyres, quick fitment very happy indeed."
Very good and professional service 👍
I have used [REDACTED] for many years and find their competitively priced tyres and excellently chosen fittibg centres first class.
Good price & easy to use
The garage was easy to get to and the men were friendly and efficient.
Great service and good prices. The web site is one of the best.
Cheapest price for good quality tyres and fitted at my preferred garage on a day and time convenient to me.
"Excellent service. Price for tyres and fitting at [REDACTED] was very competitive and I found a convenient fitting date and time at a local garage, Chorley Autovolk. Fitting was prompt, professional and courteous. I am very happy to recommend both [REDACTED] and also Chorley Autovolk."
easy to order tyres local fitters AWR very good all in 5/5
"Straight forward and very pleased. Initially went onto [REDACTED] via Google. Used drop down list, found my car, correct tyre size etc. Picked brand of tyres I wanted, used nearest garage, picked time slot. Called on date and time, my garage were very courteous, had my tyres already in, fitted straight away. Guys very polite. I used Staplehurst Tyres and would certainly recommend."
Very reasonable price and they come to your house to fit.
"A good price for the tyres I needed, a good selection of tyres to choose from and a easy to use website."
"Easy, good price and local garage available."
"Very good service received, and the best price (10% off on the day)"
Best prices on tyres fitted at a trusted local garage
"Good price, excellent garage service"
It was very easy to figure out the tyres required for my car from the [REDACTED] website. There was sufficient information to compare and choose the tyres. Transaction and checkout was smooth and fitting service experience was great.
Very good price and next day delivery
"Brilliant service tyres were sent on time and fitted ,would definatly recommend xxx ☺"
"Straightforward, easy, speedy, and trustworthy service, both for buying and fitting tyres."
"Excellent, smooth process. Bought on-line. Went to the partner (Bathwick Tyres) and got them fitted by a friendly and attentive team. What's not to like?"
Good price. Easy service.
"A very convenient way of ordering tyres, coupled with a competitive price, plus the option of using a mobile fitter - saving time and expense involved in travelling to a garage or other place."
"In all a good service from purchasing the tyres on line and the local garage that fitted them, I did find the same product cheaper on line but for me it was convenient to have them fitted locally."
"Great choice of tyres, got just what I was looking for at a price that was extremely competitive, good communication throughout the process, the chosen fitters were extremely close to home and did an excellent job at the time arranged, definitely give it go, I would use them again"
Perfect process. Entire process from online selection to tyres fitted worked perfectly
Easy to pick what you want for your budget and like seeing the ratings to compare tyres. Choice of garages and timeslots to suit so flexible. All straightforward and would use again.
"Good choice of tyres with recommendations, and convenient fitting bay"
Spot on Again. As always excellent tyre selection presented on the website. Clear and precise info available to assist in making your choice. I ordered as fully fitted and my chosen location in Market Rasen was fully prepared and ready when I arrived.On current and past performance I will always look to them first.
Good website with easy to follow instructions and good choice of tyres . No hassle fitting - drive in drive out at a quality fitting centre close to my location.
"Website rubbish Garage superb. If this had a 2.5 out of 5 then that would be fair on both the garage and [REDACTED].[REDACTED] themselves, what a shambles. Ordered tyres on the Saturday then gets a email on Monday evening (5.30) saying tyres couldn’t not be delivered and my automatic fitting day / time was Friday. The tyres then came in and my day / time was changed by [REDACTED] to Thursday! Friday worked so no issue but to then change to Thursday without any verbal communication is just poor. Why ask for a customers phone number if you ain’t going to call them!The garage on the other hand were great. No trouble whatever day. Quick on the day. Can’t speak of the garage highly enough"
Managed to get better tires for thebetter tires for. Better tires for less! Managed to get better tires for the price of basic. Everything when well. If you add extras (Tracking) make sure you remind the fitter.
"Great value and good quality product. I was a little put off by some of the negative feedback on this review site, however as a previous customer I decided to make a purchase. I am glad I did as the whole process has been very smooth and I have been very satisfied. Perhaps some acknowledgement that the order is on its way would be an improvement to the service, as it was a day later than predicted and I ended up asking where it was on the day it was delivered. That would be a time saving on both sides I would suggest.My experience may be better than some, since I did not have them sent to a fitting station, preferring to use my very reliable local garage(Bitz) for this, as I had no deadline to meet to get them fitted.I would be very happy to use this company again."
"Can't beat the price, and the UK based customer service is excellent... I have been unfortunate in that both my orders have had to be re-scheduled due to failed delivery of the tyres, hence the loss of a star - but we worked through it!"
"Helpful fitting partner. Good tyres, competitive price and good fitting partner."
"First rate. Excellent prices and best of all, not subsequently bombarded with marketing emails. I put a complaint in to Tyre Shopper about their policy of sending so many emails. [REDACTED] will have my business in future. M"
I have used your service twice and have no complaints. ATS were very helpful and refitted a defective valve with no quibble.
Convenient and easy process. Great competitive pricing and very easy to organise.
Friendly staff quick service and great price !
Its quick and easy on-line and you can book a convenient time slot to have them fitted.
Good price and service from my local garage
Brilliant Staffs.Friendly behaviours.
Simple to use and good prices
"Good value, easy to arrange and convenient."
"easy to use, good price"
Very easy to use and have always been reliable.
Great value keep you informed
"Excellent service, website easy to use. Great selection of tyre's and good prices. Fitting was really good a real professional service. Will certainly use again."
"Easy yo use website and fast,efficient delivery and fitting"
"The whole experience, from buying to fitting, was easy. I bought very well priced branded tyres at a budget tyre price which were fitted quickly by an experienced local dealer at a time which suited my availability."
"Have used you before 4 or 5 times always competitive prices and always good value , will use you all the time now as don’t want all the hastle of sorting tyres out"
Needed tyres replacing by a mobile service at home. All went well and would use again.
"So easy to use, reliable pricing and ability to choose your preferred sales/fitting point"
Simple and easy online ordering process. Choose day and time at my local ATS for fitting. £10 cheaper per tyre than buying from ATS. Would definitely use again
Faultless process from start to finish. Very happy with Wellingborough Tyres that provided the fitting service too. It goes without saying that i was also happy with the price quoted and the discount code offered.
"So easy. Very easy process, picked the tyres I wanted, picked the garage I wanted them fitted at and two days later I turn up (at a time of my choosing) and all done in 45 minutes. Perfect!"
Easy the tyres were there waiting and the fitters couldn’t have been more helpful
"GOOD PRICE AND SERVICE, NO PROBLEMS."
"excellent price, excellent service"
Cheap and quick fitting
"Straightforward and appointment on time. Straightforward, informative and appointment on time.On booking, an on screen calendar enables easy selection of garage with a suitable range of dates and times.On arrival at the chosen garage ATS in our case, immediate attention is given to your needs, and refreshments offered, while you can view the work as it is being undertaken.An easy procedure met my needs."
"Great price , delivered on timeThanks👍🏽"
"Great tyres, on time, excellent service"
Very good service at ST Tyres in Fraserburgh
Easy to buy and easy to choose a tyre fitter near me at a convenient time.
"easy to use, fair price and local fitting centres."
Great experience from local fitter[REDACTED] is great as it has a fair price and has local fitters (Golden hill garage-very friendly and great service)
"Easy to use, you can choose the tyre of your choice. You can then choose a local tyre fitter and time to suit you to get your tyre fitted."
"Good service and fitting partner. Good service, reasonable price, good fitting partner"
Easy to use website and book local garage at a time that suits.
Good tyres. Customer service good. Car runs beautifully!
Tyre fitting cancelled once then get messaged telling rme that tyre fitting is going ahead that morning( the rescheduled date) only to turn up at the garage to find they had not received the tyres. Send a complaint to [REDACTED] and never yet received a reply.
Price was good but arranging fitting I had to sort it out myself with the garage as date I booked online was not available and my alternative date that was arranged with your call handler it seems that she did not confirmed it with the garage so it was not booked by them?
"Why not try [REDACTED] I did Im pleased. Been using [REDACTED] for sometime now and never had a bad experience. Good price, tyres have always lasted a decent length of time and fitting has been easily arranged."
Best price for the tyres I wanted. Major downside was the garage who fitted them. Nuts weren't tightened properly to such an extent that wheels could have come off.
Good service overall but delivery was late. Handled well but an inconvenience.
"Hassle free service , booking time slot was on time the fitters were friendly will definetly use in the future"
Simple and efficient transaction combined with the excellent customer service from ATS Thirsk
The company that fitted the tyres chipped the paint on the inside of every wheel.
"The fitting experience was poor, i had to go back twice. Firstly for the balancing and then because one of the tyres kept deflating, the deflating issue had to then be rectified by another garage at my cost as I had by then lost confidence in the fitting garage to rectify it."
"[REDACTED]: 1) failed to keep original booking date 2) failed to show up for rearranged date and time 3) failed to address issue (2), just offered new appointment with another centre 4) failed to consider that original booking was for mobile fitting and alternative centre did not offer this"
"Tyres fitted by a 'Premier Garage' but wheels were not balanced -causing vibration at 70mph, which then had to be sorted."
Excellent. Good prices and mobile fitting included! Fitter was on time and did the job quickly and to a good standard.
"Competitive prices, fast delivery."
Very easy to use. Helpful & friendly service from the tyre fitters.
Ordered on-line and gave details of my standard vehicle. Arrived for mid-morning appointment to be told that none of the equipment was capable of lifting it. The staff were critical of their boss who had supplied them with innapropriate lifting equipment which they don't use. Having already paid for the tyres + fitting I had no choice but to load up the 4 tyres and drive 3 junctions down the Motorway to another affiliated garage and have them fitted that afternoon.. Wasted my day.There's no point being able to order on-line if the the computer does'nt recognise and decline unsuitable vehicles at the point of purchase. If in doubt I suggest you contact your local [REDACTED] prior to ordering on-line to save a wasted journey. I was offered 10% discount on a future purchase which did'nt thrill me much.I hope you have the opportunity to read this Mr. Cole.
Tyre order was delayed which was a bit frustrating but was rescheduled. I called the garage fitting the tyre for me and managed to get in the following day so all good.Great prices and customer service.
"Disappointing but got there in the end. Tyre not delivered on selected date. Delivered to the garage on the third appointment. Emailed [REDACTED] twice with no response. Yes the tyre was slightly cheaper, but would you rather not just pay £10 or so more, and get one fitted the same day?"
"excellent service ,excellent price and first class service by PYPERS garage south shore BLACKPOOL"
"Cheap tyres Not great service. Booked an original 9am slot. Received an e-mail telling me it was rescheduled to 12pm. Minor inconvenience. But when I arrived at 9am in the hope of leaving it with them, the garage had no record of a booking under my name. They luckily managed to fit me in at the end of the day."
Very good service. Allowed me to book a reputable garage. Tyres are just what I needed st a very reasonable price. Have used [REDACTED] before and would definitely recommend and I will be using them again
"Fast. Straight forward. Found what I wanted, at a price I could afford. Fitted at my preferred dealership at a time convenient to me. Great service. Thanks."
"Live up to their name good tyres, excellent in the rain, fitting by McConnechy in Wick efficient and on time, pleasant and helpful staff"
"Good deal on the tyres, was able to replace like for like at the same great price by going back to past orders. HiQ were excellent"
It allows you to take your time and compare different tyres in your own time without any pressure. Good deals and easy to book with large selection of local garages.
No nonsense straight forward. Better quality than others value tyres
Great prices and quick service
"Excellent service and low cost, good quality tyres."
"Quality tyres at a good price, quick service and good fitting."
Competitive pricing. Ease of purchase. Ease of arranging fitting.
"Great service. Delivered on time, pleasant fitting partner. Reasonable price"
Lowest price available and also arranged for a local garage within a mile to fit the tyres at short notive
Grwat service and prices.
Known brands at great prices fast and reliable local fitting.
"Easy to use, excellent prices. Grear service"
"Best prices, arranged a local garage fitting within a mile of where I live"
"Good price,. Simple to arrange"
Price right and easy to access fitting locally
I will definitely go again. Really good experience from start to finish- easy website to navigate and a deal for my tyres into the bargain.Appointment bang on time.
"Found your service and that of ATS very good and was satisfied with the work done. Had initial problems with booking times as time I selected was found to be not available. However, alternative availability was satisfactory. Only problem was that ATS were not able to carry out the free alignment checks after fitting the tyres as I believes someone had damaged their equipment. I have made alternative arreangements for this.Thanks for your service"
"Good prices, efficient service."
Upon arrival Phil behind counter was very customer friendly and and said take a seat and I will get car in workshop
"Great prices and service. Great prices, easy site to use. In conjunction with their fitting partners, everything once again went without a hitch. I'd recommend them."
After getting the tyres fitted they were filthy dirty and I had black marks all over my alloys that took me ages to scrub off
[REDACTED] did not communicate with the service center correctly. Re booked to an annoying time
"When I turned up I could see the two guys working were completely rushed off their feet and were a little behind as their equipment had failed. I spoke to Tony and considering it seemed quite a stressful time he remained really friendly, upbeat and willing to help. It took a little longer than an hour to change my two front tyres but as they were working on other cars and short staffed it was completely understandable. When I returned a week later to have the torque checked the same two employees were in the middle of changing the tyres on two other cars, they came right over and both quickly checked my tyres. I was thinking I’d be waiting around but I was only there a few minutes. They gave fantastic service and had a great attitude!"
"Purchased online, convenient date given, local garage gave excellent service. Whole experience fantastic, will definitely buy again through [REDACTED], such an easy process. The tyres I bought had great reviews and have proven themselves; I could feel the difference driving instantly. Thanks"
"Good service again from [REDACTED] and fitting centre, tyres on time, good selection of fitting times, kept updated on progress and good customer care, definitely will use again."
Faultless experience from start to finish. Very please with the fitting service too by Wellingborough Tyres. It goes without saying i was also happy with the price quoted and rhe discount code offered.
"No customer service phone number, and customer service only work office hours. They sent me the wrong tyres and it took three emails and four days to get a response from them."
"Booking process was quick and easy with confirmation from the garage. Service was first class, so much so I used Cargill's Autos for my MoT the next week. I will certainly use [REDACTED] again."
"Good price and very good service, Not one problem in the whole booking and operation"
Reasonable priced and always good service from my local fitters.
"Good fast response and tyres delivered on time. However partner garage fitting I would only rate at 2 star. 1. fitter was not going to clean rims to ensure airtight tyre seating till I suggested it. Wheel nuts were put back with air gun but checked after with torque wrench which begs question what torque was put on by air gun....I have since loosened and re-torqued the nuts....I gave the torque settings.Wheel nuts were done up in a circular way i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4 instead of opposites i.e. 1, 3, 4, 2....basic knowledge lacking which does not give confidence for any other action that may have been required.Free tracking check.....he did not make sure rack was centralised....good job I did. Garage does not have Castor/Camber checking equipment....surely a must in these days of bad potholes to check suspension alignment for new tyres.Perhaps it was unfortunate the senior was busy with a rep at the time."
5* despite a hiccup! I got an email from [REDACTED] at 5.15pm to say the next morning's fitting had to be cancelled because the tyres had not been confirmed as 'arrived' by the fitting centre. I phoned customer services at 8.45 the next morning and the lady was excellent in dealing with the matter. She said she would call the fitting centre immediately to see if they had now arrived and call me back. 10 minutes later she called back to say they were there and all was well. This was not [REDACTED] problem and I understand and applaud their procedure of checking tyres ordered have arrived to prevent a customer showing up at the fitting centre when the tyres aren't there.
"Easy to buy, lots of choice and plenty of garages to choose from"
Fitter gave great customer service
"Excellent service, straight forward uncomplicated, honest and most of all great value for money."
A good price and quick delivery. Fitting agent ATS was good and efficient.
Great service will use again. All very easy tyres turned up when they said they would fitted in 40 minutes what more can you ask for very happy with the service 😁
"Great service, delivered to garage on day they said and fitting centre were brilliant ( gils motor factors) will definitely use again"
"Booked on line took the car over the next day waited 1/2 hour then the car went in, all done in a hour great service."
"Smooth process. Easy to use website, good value tyres, good service at garage."
Good price and great service on my driveway
1st date was cancelled as tyres not available
Goodyear Tyres. Found the tyres that I needed at a reasonable price. I did receive an email to advise that the fitting centre couldn't fit my tyres on the day I had selected. I needed to have the tyres fitted as my MOT had been booked in and it would have failed with out the tyres. It would have been useful if the customer service representative that I spoke to advise of other fitting centres that would be able to fit on the day selected. Rather than saying that there is nothing that they could do.
"The service was exceptional, I ordered the wrong tyres and called the call centre who correct the mistake at no charge and delivered and fitted the tyres as planned"
"Price good, ordering simple and fitting arrangements went as planned."
"Terry of Cambridge. I've used [REDACTED] many times, their choice of tyres, prices, delivery and tyre fitting service is first class. I have never been disappointed."
All went smoothly with purchase and fitting
"Good price, convenient times and locations"
"Does what is says. Good company at a great price. Booked on line selected ATS as my garage. In straight away, also looked at my wing mirror with no charge from garage. Would recommend ATS & [REDACTED]. A*"
"Although cheaper on line,had 2 issues with the choice of tyres your web site & lady on your help line recommended to me"
"[REDACTED] & their customer service were very good, let down by fitting service not BC fault."
Huge selection of tyres and some good deal vouchers available. Good selection of local garages and easy booking procedure. Easy to find correct size and product suitable for your vehicle with search feature and clear labeling graphics on the website.
First time using [REDACTED]. Had a 10% flash sale which made the the cheapest for the tyres I needed. Simply paid online and had them fitted by appointment using one of their partners nearby. Process simple and efficient. Will be first point of call in future.
"Straightforward way to purchase tyres. Was able to study the tyre choice and make an informed opinion without any pressure from tyre salesman or tyrefitter. Got a great price, picked a really good local tyreshop and a time that suited me, The tyres were fitted very quickly and I was left with a positive feeling from using [REDACTED]. Already recommended to friends and family"
"Booking experience with [REDACTED] Johnson garage. Booking experience with [REDACTED] was good. Liked the follow up email and reminders. But the garage was not very good. I dropped my car off at the right time, they told me when it would be ready. Went to collect, car not ready. Took an hour to change 2 tyres, and the free tracking and brake checks were not done. No explanation, no apology. Very disappointed with Johnson garage in Watford"
well iv had my appointment cancelled 3 times and its now 8 days after my original appointment and just waiting for that message to say todays appointment will also be cancelled
"I found the whole experience, quick professional and competitively priced. Thank you. Would definitely recommend to everyone needing tyres."
"Was a very smooth procedure,payed for tyres,booked tyre change date,in and out of garage within 40 minutes.Perfect"
"Good service from [REDACTED], as I would expect, did not exceed expectations Disappointed with garage. Took an hour to replace 2 tyres, I dropped off at the correct time, car wasn’t ready when they said it would be. No apology or explanation. They did not do the free tracking or brake check. Pretty rubbish really. Though they did fit the tyres I suppose."
Fuss free ordering and very easy to understand. The tyres arrived quickly at the garage from which there was a good service
"Great tyres and service, will use again"
So easy to order and arrange online and at a very reasonable price too! Excellent service. Thanks
"Easy to search for the specific tyre you're after and the quality desired. Then, easy to search for a fitting place. I will definitely be using again!!! Thank you for a great service!"
Great pricing and wide range of brands from budget to premium. Excellent fitting service. A very convenient way to buy tyres
Easy to use. Local fitter. Good prices
"Hassle free, cheaper than rivals, local, sufficient stock. Overall excellent service."
Excellent value and great service
Easy and convenient to use. Very straightforward to order tyres and you get to choose your local tyre fitting company and appointment time to suit yourself.. Also you know exactly how much it will cost you and you can pay for them online.
"This is the second time I used [REDACTED].com, its easy to use and the the Tyres prices it’s very good specially for the top brand Tyres. I recommend [REDACTED].com to my family and friends and they are very happy that I recommend [REDACTED].com for them."
"Great web site and when I chose the wrong tyre size, customer service was fantastic. Would definitely recommend to friends and family. Thanks again."
Tyres from [REDACTED] and fitting at ATS. All went well and saved a few £’s.
"Delayed tyre delivery, poor communication, had to ring up to find information since no reply to emails."
Delivered and fitted on time. This is the 3rd or 4th time I have bought from [REDACTED] and used Express of Walton to fit. Every time has been excellent. Couldn't be better service!
"Excellent service, just wish they could have been fitted a day or two sooner."
Best prices online speedy local fitting centres
Quality tyres at the lowest prices fitted locally
"An easy system to use. An easy system to buy very competitively priced tyres fitted close to where you live too. Giving them five stars even though they changed my accepted booking to a day later, then after agreeing that they then moved the fitting time to two hours later. Luckily I was flexible too. However, their communications were excellent.Interested to discover [REDACTED].com and the tyre fitters I chose, ATS, are both owned by Michelin.I would use them again, definitely recommended."
"Competitive price, efficient website and polite and helpful customer service representative"
Very good service competitive price. Very easy good tyre choice fast and convenient the fitting service was also quick and efficient.
A really convenient way to shop for tyres at a very reasonable price and typically fitted at a shop close by. No hassle!
Excellent service and prices
"They are so easy to use ,you get to choose which tyres at the cost you can afford with reviews on all the tyres great 👍"
"Easy to book online. Arrived and seen immediately. Arrived to return in 30-45 mins once tyre done. Tesco, Greg’s and Costa in close walking distance. Received a phone call after 45 mins to say the tyres were changed. Good fast service."
There was a bit of a wobble over the agreed time of the appointment
Waste of time and effort. Total waste of time and effort. Given days until the arranged appointment for fitting. Delivered the car today to the selected garage and they haven't arrived. This was despite the text this morning to confirm my appointment. It was extremely important they were fitted today before needing the vehicle for collecting a caravan tomorrow. On hold to the non existent customer services department now for over 15 mins. Pathetic.Wont use again and if you value your time I would advise you not to do so either.
"Awful experience, purchased 4x brand new tyres to find one has a large bulge in the side wall. This is an extremely dangerous issue and its been 4 days since I reported it and had practically no response, just been asked to take a survey as to what's wrong. Nobody has been in contact and considering the potential danger I face the customer care from [REDACTED] is non existent. I will never use this service again."
"Everything went to plan, tyres were at the fitting shop on time,excellent service from Express Tyre Service."
Poor service. Had car booked in for a am appointment on the 23/07/19Arrived at garage only to be told two of the tyres were not there luckily I was in the position too leave the car there for the day but garage couldn't guarantee that the tyres would be there on that day. Tried contacting [REDACTED] with no joy so basically paid for tyres and fitting and was left to sort out myself. I should have been advised the tyres weren't there I emailed phoned ect and no reply had to leave my car for the full day on the hope the tyres were delivered at some point.The tyres were fitted and had to leave work early to collect car can't fault the garage at all but [REDACTED] customer service was shocking and even now on the 1/08/19 have not had any correspondence from them apart from a email asking to review the service.This experience would make me think twice about ordering tyres from here again.
"Could not be happier with the service and price. A small independent tyre fitter, really friendly and cheaper than the big name chains, and unlike them, I didn't feel I was getting ripped off and didn't get upsold on other services like tracking.This will be my go-to place from now on."
I have to say [REDACTED] booking to selection of my tyres ok but problem arised from fitting company they were low quality a-z no respect at all pro tyre Enfield don't choose them total disappointment
Booking was easy but the service at the centre on the day was disappointing
"Easy to order, good value, handy location for fitting. Only downside is that I missed the money off offer by a couple of days."
Convenient enough but had to wait 3 extra days for fitting due to not being delivered and then the garage said they could of done me 2 tyres cheaper 😂 but after they fitted them
Very good service and good price. Kept me informed when delivery was delayed for a couple of days.
Excellent service. Ordered what I wanted. Then got a prompt email advising me if local garage to get them fitted. Very professional and good value for money. Very pleased.
"Happy customer. Easy to use, reasonably priced and lots of options"
"Thank you for the whole experience, great quick service and a very good mechanic team who completed the job in good time."
"Easy to buy, easy to select a local garage, no hassle at the garage - they knew it was a BC order and the tire was already there waiting AND it was cheaper than everybody else!"
New tyres. Very pleased with 4 Avon tyres at £62 each fitted. System worked exactly as it should and chosen garage was competent. Thank you.
"Great job done very well. Left my keys with the man behind the desk, waited in customers waiting room, had a cuppa then before you know it car is all done. Was meant to have free brake and winter check but couldn't wait but have been told I can get it done any time, just got to ring and make an appointment."
There was a delay in delivering the tyre and I had to change the fitting date directly with the fitting company
Great service. Quick. Reasonable priced
"Easy to organise, and good value."
Excellent service & price.
"Excellent choice and service from [REDACTED]. The company that fitted the tyres in Povey Cross Road Hookwood were excellent. Friendly, helpful and offered first class service. Premises were clean & modern, with good facilities. Would recommend both them & [REDACTED]"
"I arrived and had to wait for someone to come to speak to me and when he did I was told that he was busy and that he would not be able to fit my tyres for at least an hour and to come back later! I said that I would go shopping and come back in an hour, he just walked away leaving me standing there and just left me standing there. He didn’t ask for my keys and so I had shout to him and ask what to do with them! When I came back into the waiting room he just pointed to my car to indicate that the car was finished and off I went! So much for the expected brake test that I was offered! Not a mention of that."
I've used [REDACTED] quite a few timesI'm very pleased with the quality and prices.
"Sent the wrong tyres to be fitted. When ordering, the web page specifically asks for the make and model of vehicle yet doesn’t distinguish the need for run flats on the particular model (BMW 6 series convertible). Pretty hopeless really!"
I was emailed at end of the day before the day my tyres were due to be fitted to tell me they were not at the garage. Fortunately I decided to go to the fitters to let them know and they told me they had them and proceeded to fit them. I have had no communication from [REDACTED] since.
"Without a doubt, the best way to buy a tyre. You don't have to put up with some garage telling a product is the best purely because they have it in stock. Its also consistently cheaper then all of my local garages."
"Easy buying experience,prices competitive,garage I chose were efficient and professional."
"Postponed fitting date, no information from your staff, lied to from your staff so they don't lose my sale, staff could not decide when my tyres would arrive and didn't know where they were, gave me two fitting times that were different from my original postponed time, clueless as to what was happening and I had to deal directly with the garage to arrange a fitting date."
"I booked an appointment online and when I arrived at the garage he said there was no booking on his computer. He also said he was on his own would fit it in but he had other jobs to do first, so would take up to three hours. I decided to rebook for the following week. Inconvenient and cost money to get back there."
"First appointment was cancelled as weren’t delivered in time. Second appointment, I waited and hour before they told me only one tyre had been delivered. Had to be away from the office for a third day to finally get the other tyre fitted. Would not recommend."
Much cheaper way of buying new premium tyres than direct with the company that fitted them. Can't quite work out how they do that but don't really care.
"When you don't have the budget and need tyres in an emergency, I can't speak highly enough."
Tyre fitter marked alloys then I had to return a further two times to rectify the tyre loosing pressure. So damaged wheel and subsequent visits to rectify poor fitting.
First time I tried went through whole process to find tyer was out of stock. Then garage I went to was not helpful at all
"Selected the wrong tyres originally, [REDACTED] noticed my mistake and when I called to correct my order it was hassle free."
"Easy to book, time slot and garage of my choice then a great service fitting the tyres."
I really like the fitter service I use and [REDACTED] gives me a decent price.
It was really easy to order my tyres and find a local garage to fit them .
I choose 8 because of the staff not because of the way your expect your staff to work under the pressure you put them. I waited 3 hours after my book in time before I was able to leave the tyre area. Having to pass on a airport run to one of my competitors in the chauffeur business.
"Website easy to use,good price,lifetime warranty with my tyres plus local fitting services near me.Good communication from [REDACTED]."
Will use again. Really easy to use and competitive pricing
"The staff where friendly and helpful in phone ,but the problems where with the order of tyres I had done 2 or 3 days later got email saying can't get them so advised on another similar type thought not a problem till i got to garage and garage had recieved my original order and 2 further sets of tyres which also had to change booking day as apparently first set weren't in but garage said they recieved them on the day. Complete mix up."
Great service...ATS were excellent
Good price and quick fitting
"Great website and service from the fitting centre, plus a fantastic price....what more can I say !!!!"
"Reasonable price ,easy to order and pay.good choice of local fitters."
Good value
Fast effective and got a decent discount.
Ordered on a Wednesday for Saturday fitting. The tyre didn't arrive and couldn't be fitted until the following Tuesday.
Customer service received has been shocking. Complaint raised over a week ago and still no solution to the problem. Takes around 2 days to get a response. Every email I have received has been from a different person.
The garage that I chose to fit my tyres spent more time going round my car looking for other work they could carry out rather than get on with fits two front tyres and do the tracking. 2 hrs 20 mins for this to be carried out. I Will be having tyres off the shelf in future and fitted at Just Tyres. The name speaks for its self.
Very easy process and cheaper than others
Highly recommend. Excellent! Great price and timed slot for fitting worked perfectly at a garage just up the road from me...... what more do you need? Thanks for a great service 😊
Very good reliable price in tyre and. Quality as good Booking as fitted as time as when it prefect for me easy not have to waiting next customers at garage it possible my booking as quick service!! Great!!!
"Easy to order, lots of fitting station, just fitting station didn't do what I asked for when I ordered."
Good service and choice of tyre fitting locations.Happy with the price and the ability to book a date and time that suits.
"5 Service. Great service, great prices!"
great service and easy to use. only wish there was some discount promotion on at the time of purchasing the brand of tyres.
Original booking date / location made but garage then declined booking
Brilliant service and the garage who fitted Collisons cowplain were super friendly. honest and efficient
"Very efficient service, good price for tyres"
"[REDACTED] failed to get my tyres to my selected garages not once but twice , and kept asking me how I wanted to proceed, obviously just deliver the tyres to the garage. The same thing happened the last time I ordered tyres from [REDACTED] but I let it go, I thought it might have been a one off but the exact same thing happen this time , just days of replying to emails and arranging fitting days over the phone with my garage NO THANKS"
2 out 2. I have used [REDACTED] twice and I have been very content with the service. quality tyres supplied to local garages and keeping local independent companies in business.
"Internet experience good, booking slot not as organised as should be"
After being given a fitting date when the order was placed I then received an email saying that it would be pushed out by an additional 2 days due to unforeseen problems. This email was sent after closing hours so I couldn't make contact to try and resolve the issue sooner. I then had to call back then next day numerous times to find a solution. It turned out that it was simply because the arrival of the tyres hadn't been confirmed with the fitting centre. Turns out tyres were there after all and they could be fitted on the requested day but by this point not until lunchtime and I'd had to take time off work to get this sorted and done.
1 of the tire fitted has a slow puncture.
"The guy who greated me basically just grunted at me. They did not replace my spare tyre and I had to go back to collect it, there was no apology for the mistake or for me having to take more time out from work to collect the tyre. One of my tyres then kept deflating and I once again had to go back to get this rectified. They guys on my 3rd visit were very nice but explained that the rim had not been prepared/ cleaned properly on the first fit nor was there enough sealant which is what caused the leak. Again no apology or any offer of recompense for my time or expence in 2 addition visits which were at [REDACTED] fault"
Your auto system ordered the wrong tyres for my car. Result my repair could not be done. The second appointment was supposed to happen between 8.30 and 12 but the fitter had an all day booking so arrived around 2pm.my car was off the road for 6 extra days because of your error and much time was wasted. True you did not charge me the difference in price on the right tyre but you caused me far more trouble than the £15 discount.
Had 2 tyres fitted was not told at the time we would have to go to ford dealers after fitting to have the tyre valves reset.
"No issue with online process. No issue with online selection and pre-purchase of tyres, or booking 4wheel alignment.Tyre fitting centre damaged steering wheel during alignment (needs full refurbishment); being sorted out but currently still unresolved"
"I was told the night before that the tyres hadn't arrived so could be fitted on the Tuesday and earliest would be Thursday, I emailed to ask why and yes that would be ok. Still had no response..... My wife then has a phone call mid day Tuesday so say the tyres were there ready to be fitted. When fitting was taking place all the tyre fitters did was swear. Not great if children were present."
Great selection of tyres to mmet your budget requirements
Web site easy to use. Price good. One snag was that my booking was not initially seen by the dealer who seemingly had to manually transfer the booking for his staff to see it? This hadn't been done till after I arrived! [REDACTED]/dealer systems not integrated? However all went well after that. Thanks.
you said a fitting date then changed it
"Exactly as ordered, fitting was arranged and fitting company were excellent."
Extremely easy to find the right tyres and book the fitting. I found it particularly useful to see how the tyres were rated for fuel efficiency and stopping capabilities in the wet. I would definitely use this service again.
"Easy to use website, very good prices, easy to arrange appointments and good service from ATS Llandrindod Wells."
Good price and excellent service. Plenty of fitting choices.
Some confusion over booking. When I arrived at the chosen garage they didn't have me booked in. The garage fitted the tyres in the allotted time however.
Great tyre prices and excellent service from Lovegreen garage (as always)
"Easy and great value. Easy, reliable and great value !!"
"Arrived on time, excellent introduction, superb swift service and not a mark put on the wheels."
Quick and accurate service
"You know how good a company is when things don't quite go right and see how they respond. My tyres were delayed for my home fitting, but [REDACTED] responded very quickly and effectively to solve the problem. I will use again."
"Mechanic was friendly, on time and efficient (on the hottest day of the year!!). Well worth the £6 to have tyres fitted at home. Very satisfied with him and [REDACTED].com.Also good price for tyres.Would recommend to friends and use again."
Had to wait more than an hour in the garage to have fitted. What’s the point of making a timed appointment?
Excellent friendly service completed on time at agreed price.
"Great service, quick availability, local garage did a good job"
"Polite, helpful staff. Clean and tidy garage. Professional job."
"Excellent tyres why go anywhere else. Excellent tyres, excellent price, excellent service"
"Fast and Efficient. Fast, efficient service and a great new tyre. A quality product and service delivered at a competitive price."
"Excellent service from ordering through to fitting, used [REDACTED] many times and always the most competitive on price."
"Garage was great, very easy transaction and service was great."
Great value for money and super to have the new tyres delivered direct to the garage who are going to fit them for you! Excellent service too from M & R Motors Campbeltown who went the extra mile to help us out.
Great price and fitted hassle free!
Good service and good price.
Competitive prices and excellent service by Driveway tyres.
Excellent service. Came to my workplace and fitted a new tyre in 45 minutes. Couldn’t recommend a better service!
Sunside garage was first class
"Massive selection of tyres on all sizes, selected fitted option with appointment and fitted on the day selected excellent service"
"[REDACTED] new tyres fitted by professional garage. Easy to compare tyres, choose and pick a garage for fitting.Great prices.Used a local garage, who were very professional, tyres were waiting and they kept to my time slot.Have used before and will use again.Top quality service"
Great quality tyres at a good price and fitted on time.
"Great Price and Service. The price quoted for my tyres was the most competitive by the and arrangements were made quickly. They were fitted by Jim Dickson's and although they do not operate an appointment system, the work was carried out efficiently without having to wait very long. Always a pleasure to deal with such a friendly place"
Better if [REDACTED] mentions Tyre Thread Depth. I bought 2 Front Goodyear Eagle NCT5 A 205/45 R18 Y (86)) and 2 Rear Bridgestone Turanza T005 DriveGuard 225/40 R18 Y (92) fully fitted by one of the local garages on [REDACTED]. travelled only 2 miles in total from the time the tyres were fitted to the pre booked bmw service appointment who recorded the tyres depth as front 8mm and rear as 7mm. don't know if measurements taken by bmw are wrong. But when I looked at the rear tyres I strongly felt they were only slightly better in depth than my old tyres but i didn't raise issue when got them fitted. It would be best if [REDACTED] mentions tyre thread depth so that customers know better what they are buying .
"Excellent. Quick, easy, convenient and value for money."
"Great service and value as usual. Third time I’ve used [REDACTED] with the home fitting service now and I wouldn’t go anywhere else now, great prices and no hassle with the home fitting, great service."
Very good value
"makes it very easy to choose tyres, select a fitting centre and book a time, well done BC!"
"Best deal I found, with choice of local garages to fit the tyres."
"Large selection of tyres, clear rating system. good price and all inclusive. easy to book with garage."
"The tyres are great so far: on a good road they are very quiet, on a bad road they're not very quiet, but nothing really would be. No challenging conditions to test their grip yet, but I'm hopeful.The only shortcoming was the tyre fitting contractor which was pretty basic to be honest. As a bloke, I don't mind going to a backstreet tyre place, though I rather grew out of them some years ago, but I don't think in this day and age a lot of women would have been particularly happy with it."
Good quality tyres at a competitive price. Process for selecting was very quick and easy. Garage I chose fitted the tyres quickly and efficiently within an hour.
We have already submitted a review soon after the tyres were fitted
"Best value tyres, good range and availability and delivered to local fitters next day."
Good price and good service from the fitting garage
"Good service. Great prices when compared to other tyre fitters.Location good, easy to get to. Good choice of booking times. Propped.Friendly service."
"Good service. Easy to book, efficient fitting of tyres."
"Easy online selection and ordering process. Competitive prices. Am repeat customer, so confident of service provided."
"Excellent service, great choice of premium and budget tires. Thanks."
"Good Experience. Good price, convenient fitting location & time.Prompt professional attention, with a free wheel alignment check that confirmed no adjustment required.The fitting garage also contacted [REDACTED] that they believed I had left a headphones adaptor in their reception area which was not mine, but it showed that they cared."
"Excellent service from you just a pity about your choice of fitters who were rude and also broke censor of which I had to chase them up a week later, fitted censor to then be told I had to sort the recoding myself!!"
"Message received to advise of time for fitting (Tyre Spot at Team valley) excellent service from them and [REDACTED], extremely professional,in future all tyres will be from you"
Great product at a competitive price. Good convenient fitting places
Quality of tyres supplied are of a good standard and the price is fantastic
"Easy choice from many manufacturers select fitted and appointment made easily, fitted excellently"
Easy.. efficient and good value
"Excellent service, very easy to use and and quick turn around. Came to my workplace and fitted a new tyre in 45 minutes. Couldn’t recommend a better service."
"Gd price , tyre was ready at said time"
Quick delivery. Discount codes. Lots of choice.
"Excellent service. Easy to find the right tyres. Good prices. Excellent tyre fitting service, included in the price. Garage were quick and professional."
"Used BC before, easy way to save, plus if you have a motorhome there are only a small number of locations that can accommodate it, paying a lot less to use an ideal place!"
"Easy to use, great deals"
from ordering to fitting everything verry good
Usually good fitting service
Very easy to order and had fitted at my convenience
"Fair price, easy ordering and fitting"
"Porsche 911 2004 996 Gen 2 C4S Tip Cab.VERY good price and the Fitters were superb!Thank you [REDACTED], I will use you again!"

Always have what I need and at right price plus arranging for the fitting is easy

Great value no hassle to arrange fitting
Good service and easy to access to arrange
"Easy ordering ,attractive prices, exellent fitting station"
Because of the selection of tyres available and the very competitive prices
VERY good Price and nice/good people fitting the Tyres.
I was somewhat surprised to be accused of attending on the wrong day. An apology would’ve been nice as I believe it was the owner who made the mistake
"Straightforward purchase, good customer service, they even honoured a discount code which was a website mistake, which was generous. Convenient to choose a local garage for fitting too."
"Cheapest premium brand fitted tyresGood service, tyres fitted in alloted time slot.Would definitely use their service again"
"Great guys, they had to change my original booking day BUT this ended up working out fine because I had a flat battery on the original booking day, the guys checked my alternator after I refitted the replacement battery myslef. Nice guys."
"Ease of ordering, price, prompt and fast service from the fitters."
"I normally have no problems with [REDACTED] BUT. I normally have no problems with [REDACTED] and they would normally get 5 stars. Last month however changed that. Ordered two tyres for my Kia Sportage. They were Hankook Ventus Prime 2 K115 215/70 R16 H(100). The tyres fitted showed Fuel rating C, Wet Grip C and noise rating 71. The ones I ordered showed B, C, 71. Only a slight difference I know, but that swayed me to buy those particular tyres. Messaged Bc who responded quickly, but basically told me I was wrong and that the ones I ordered were the ones fitted. Not a great response. Will think twice next time."
"Affordable, convenient"
"It was so easy and the garage (Spires, Witney) was super friendly and efficient. Will definitely use in future!"
"very good prompt service , the fitting agent were very good"
Competitive pricing and easy to use
Very easy to use and great price for exactly what I wanted.

"Good value, easy to order, excellent fitting station."
Good price and choice
Had the tyres I wanted a quite a reasonable price and they were fitted at a very professional garage very quickly.
"Cheaper than everyone else, delivered to my local tyre shop.. Quick and easy to use.."
"Great Value great service. It amazes me how simple and easy it is to book tyres (from a full choice), pay for them and just turn up to have them fitted. In my circumstances the best value budget tyres was what I was after but went for a special offer on Kumo tyres. My chosen fitter was ATS who admit they can’t beat the price of [REDACTED] tyres but I still got their great service and peace of mind through fitting the tyres. 2nd time I’ve used [REDACTED] and won’t be the last."
"Easy booking system that allowed access to the best value tyre choices. I turned up on the day, my tyres had been delivered and were fitted without any issues by ATS. The whole process was hassle free and the best value spend."
Great service for cheaper tyres
"Alloy damaged. No apology from garage after admitting fault. [REDACTED] cannot understand the total inconvenience for me to have to leave my car somewhere for repair and me having no method of transport as a result of the garages total incompetence. Although this is not [REDACTED] fault directly, they should be picking this up to sort it out efficiently. Not telling me to go and sort it and let them know, sort of thing."
Very professional
Delighted with the overall cost of tyres and the service I received from my appointed garage.
No probs very good service at garage
Quality tyres at the cheapest price
"Excellent service, no waiting time and professional people"
Easy to order and an excellent garage in genuine card
"been to this garage a couple of times with tyre problems, done while you wait, drove off happy with the work, a good experience"
Good choice of competitive tyres.
Good price and good service at garage
"Great service and felt valued. Great service and also bearing in mind I made a mistake when ordering, [REDACTED] resolved it with minimum issue/fuss. Was made to feel valued!!Thanks [REDACTED]!!"
Everything was fine although the garage I chose didn't give me the option to choose a time slot just AM or PM
Great service and great price for quality tyres
"I’ve used [REDACTED] a few times now and my experiences have always been positive. There is very good communication between them and the customer, giving a variety of reminders leading up to the tyre fitting service and should there be any delay with or issues relating to the appointment then a customer service personnel will contact to inform and do their best to make the best alternative arrangement. I’m happy with the service and will continue to use in the future"
"Easy website , great price fantastically quick service"
Service was great fitter really helpful. Accurate description of product
Good choice and easy to buy
"good price, work done to my timescale"
"Efficient, good communication, helpful garage for fitting."
"Saved a fair bit on buying from [REDACTED].com, compared to where I normally purchase my tyres from , even shopped round online but couldn't beat [REDACTED] price ,and had very pleasant and proffesional mobile fitter Doorstep Tyres come to my house so I never had to go anywhere. Highly recommend ."

Very easy to use service with a great choice of tyres at competitive prices
"Can't fault [REDACTED] . Price was good, timings worked to our lifestyle and the trye guys were friendly, knowledgeable and quick"
"Very easy site to use. Good, competitive price and also the option to get the tyres fitted when and where I chose."
Brilliant tires at a great price & fitted will definitely buy again from [REDACTED]. Great to just buy on line and turn up at a local garage for fitting. Fantastic service customer support was second to non. I've passed the link to everyone I know for tires!
"Fast delivery to your chosen garage, at a great price too"
"Great choice of tyres, great prices and easy to book for fitting at a place and time to suit me."
"Competitive prices with no issues. Turned up at the garage, waited 45 mins and drove away."
Excellent friendly service
"Buy online, pick day and time and turn up and tyres fitted. Exactly as it says on the tin"
Hidden valve cost
"Great price, great service and all fitted without any problems. Recommended!"
"Had an email the night before my tires should have been fitted, saying they weren't ready. Contacted the garage to find out what had happened turns out only 2 of the 4 had been delivered. Contacted the garage and left my number so they could contact me when they had the other two delivered.Garage was spot on, I wont be using [REDACTED] again due to going out of my way and re-arrange my week to have them fitted."
Great prices easy to follow ordering. Altogether a great service
good value for money; good communication; prompt deliveries...
Easy to sort and book and a good price.
Great service from booking online to tyres fully fitted 👌
Excellent prices and great service
I have used [REDACTED] before and have always found the site easy to use and the tyres are always good value.
I have used [REDACTED] for several years now and have always found them easy to deal with and always good value
Great service great prices
"I booked my car in for 1 new tyre to be replaced, I was booked in for 10am, arrived 15 minuets early as requested ( both kids in tow) was told come back in 45 minuets it will be ready then. Came back after an hour, my car had not even been touched asked how much longer it was going to be, another hour at least! As you can imagine the kids are truly fed up so I had to get someone to pick us up. The guy said he will ring as soon as it was done, no one called, so I called them at 3pm still not done the car was eventually don’t at 3.50pm to me that is just terrible service so I will definitely not be using you again or recommending you to any friends. Many thanks Karla"
Best price available online and excellent tyre fitting experience at the chosen garage. Will be buying again in the future.
No issue's. Garage had the tyres and fitted them. Would have been 10 if the garage had been expecting me
Excellent price & was able to have the tyres fitted at a convenient time & place that suited me. The F1 fitting centre in Bridgetown was very quick & very helpful
Good prices and convenient service. Good prices and opportunity to fit locally works well
Dealing with tyre purchase and delivery was really easy .
Great prices and a wide choice of fitting centres
Competitive and convenient. Allows me to book a tyre change and a local independent garage easily
New tyres. Quick easy service. Good value
Quick to get to local garage who where fab too
Brilliant service thank you. The tyres are great and Tim Alsop provided excellent seribe when fitting them. Thank you!
Very good price and excellent service from the tyre fitters 10/10.
Reasonably seamless experience with pretty good price.
"Good Price, Fitters pleasant"
Because the garage that fitted the tyre was fantastic and I will be using them again in fact I am but not for tyre
"Easy, price right."
Tyre type availability; good price; easily navigable web site; slick delivery service and good fitter.
Poor service from your recommended garage
"Service was flawless, price was fantastic"
"Keen prices, good range of products."
Efficient and price competitive
Excellent price. And very good tyres
Very competitive prices and a great network of tyre fitters to choose from
"Easy process, but fitting could be quicker. I had to wait 3 working days for nearest available appointment, but the fitter could get a second identical tyre delivered on the same working day for lower price."
Mitchelin primacy for the price of budget tyres. Can’t be bad
"Only 1 of the 2 tyres I ordered had been delivered when I arrived for my fitting appointment. When I raised the issue it took 7 hours to receive any acknowledgment from you and I was simply asked if my tyres had now been fitted. By this time it was too late to resolve the issue the same day (Friday), I received no further communication the following day (Saturday) which left me without tyres until I called on Monday and was told the other tyre was now there and I could have them fitted that afternoon. There was no explanation at any point about what had happened or how it would be resolved and there was nothing offered for the inconvenience caused to me."
Would have preferred notification of what time the fitter would arrive and a contact the day before other than that perfect
great idea to use this good price for the tyres fitted at a place I chose on a day to suit me.
Excellent service. Simple and decent value
"Hassle free New Tyres, at a bargain price."
"Excellent service,the partner garage ( Hilliam tyres) was first rate . Prices very good Will definitely use again."
I was a bit unsure when I came across this website as I had never heard of them but I looked at the reviews from other people and decided to give them a go. As well as the tyres being the best price I could find I chose a garage close to my house to fit them. All in all a fantastic company and will definitely be coming back Thanks
Tyre change. So easy and really good value.
"4 New Michelin Tyres on 20 Rims. I had 4 new Michelin Tyres fitted to my 20"" Graphite Rims, at a premier partner (Tyre Spot North Shields).The only thing that spoiled an otherwise pleasant fitting experience, was the fitter decided to fit bright silver balance weights 4-5 inches long to my almost black wheel barrels, which totally spoiled the look of my wheels.I have since had the wheels off and painted the weights black as were the original weights.A little thought goes a long way."
Always great prices and being able to organise delivery and fitting of the tyres makes it so convenient. This time I even opted for the mobile tyre fitter which came to the house.
"Good value and easy to arrange, should have done it years ago.Only one place to get my tyres from in the future Thanks"
"Good prices and selection. The garage I chose (CGE in Dyce) was superb. Spotlessly clean, quick and efficient. I'll be back again"
Easy to order and book time at local dealer and be assured that the price is competitive.
"very good service, the fitter was excellent"
Tyres were provided at a competitive price at the garage of my choice. Order was processed quickly with no problems. Have dealt before and will deal again.
"Tyres ordered, no email to confirm fitting, message received by phone to say that fitter could not be contacted and that we would be contacted again after fitter had been contacted. No further message. I rang fitter on planned fitting date, he had not received any order. I then rang [REDACTED]. They rang back and confirmed fitting for following day, a day late. All went to plan after that."
I had my new tyres fitted at ATSDisappointed. I had my new tyres fitted at ATS Broadheath. Reception was not particularly welcoming.After fitting I returned home and checked the pressures of my two new tyres both tyres were under inflated and one of the dust caps was just about hanging on to the valve thread.
"excellent online ordering service, happy with price, ease of use but also must say..the fitting station - 1st class tyres and autocare, Lutterworth, Leicestershire, LE17 4AB were outstanding. Nothing too much trouble, knew exactly what was ordered, fitted in timely manner, friendly service and expert knowledge. Highly recommended, please pass on feedback to them also."
"It's not actually your fault, hence the 6... After booking 2 new tyres and a service through yourselves at the Formula One garage in King's Lynn I arrived at the garage to find out they had the tyres but said I want booked in for a service. I had proof of this on your email and when looking at their order sheet could see the service clearly there too, but they still refused and stated because I hadn't arranged a time they wouldn't do. I had the time booked in as an am slot, again proven on an email but they wouldn't honour. Very very unhelpful and they said in future for me to book through themselves as opposed to you because you ""were pains""!! Not professional at all"
Fantastic. I was a bit unsure when I came across this website as I had never heard of them but I looked at the reviews from other people and decided to give them a go. As well as the tyres being the best price I could find I chose a garage close to my house to fit them. All in all a fantastic company and will definitely be coming back Thanks
"Best price and have used you before. Efficiently dealt with by Wellingborough Tyres, staff friendly and helpful."
Not a good experience they changed my booking after payment and resulted in advisory on my mot won’t use or recommend
The pricing was really competitive and choice of where to go to get the tyres fitted was excellent.
Its so quick and easy just putting in your reg and there is the info for which tyres you need as a busy mum i dnt have time to be crawling around the car looking for the tyre and then ringing round for a great price...As its all done on this site and WOW!!! great prices
Very good web site easy and gives lots of info eg prices and tyre specs plus booking and paying had no problems with fitting very goog experience I would recommend on my visit will recommend even better I received a 10% discount on my visit to your site
"Best price, easy to order and arrange, the company who came to my premises to fit the tyres were brilliant couldn't recommend him highly enough."
Great price and excellent service.
"Great prices and service. I have used BC a number of times and they always provide best prices combined with good service at their fitting centres or agents.Bought two new tyres for my car and original fitting centre couldn't do my requested date customer services quickly contacted me and made arrangements for another fitting at my convenience.Fitting centre used hand tools and correctly torqued the wheels, no windy guns used which as a DIY mechanic was good to see."
Had the tyres I was after and my local garage was able to fit the next day.
Fantastic service and great garage. Couldn't get any better
"The price for the set of Michelin CrossClimate plus tyres was very competitive and the fitting service was easy to arrange, efficient and friendly."
"The fitting dealer was not informed of my booking, so when I arrived they had no knowledge of the booking and could not fit the tyres on the day it was booked in. The only knowledge they had of a [REDACTED] fitting was a reference number on the tyres that started with BC. Also, the dealer said that if I had phoned them directly, they would have easily beaten the BC price."
"Best price, efficient and friendly staff at the garage."
Easy to book easy to get tyres fitted. Just be aware of discounts offered after you have purchased
"Great tyres, cheapest price and good fitting service. Always happy to use"
"The price was fine, this is why I chose them. However I chose my local garage based on the Callander availability and a time that suited me. I was then emailed to say that there were no slots on this day , which was a little irritating. So I asked for an alternate and Indeed this was sorted swiftly and emailed another garage for the same day a few hours later. However on that day I go to the garage at my emailed time and was told I was an hour late. I show the email and they guy blamed [REDACTED] for the wrong time given to them and basically said tough not his fault. I have to wait another 4 days and another trip to get the tyres fitted. Price is good however time is also important and personally I would pay an extra £10 for a main dealer to fit and be treated to a complimentary coffee!"
Great service from Tom the mechanic and good price for a premium tyre. Top quality at a budget price!
Great service The garage I selected declined the business but your customer service representative promptly arrange another garage and was extremely helpful
Poor customer service
not lowest price plus very later change to fitting appointment date
"Competitive price, easy website, good choice of local garage to fit, efficient service"
"Excellent service and process to order, confirm time and slot and service upon arrival was excellent."
Easy to book no wait to have tyres fitted. Very friendly helpful fitters
Good price fast delivery and local fitting
"Bought two Nankane tyres. Bought two Nankane, got a discount what’s not to like :-)"
Because your services is A1. But wasn't impressed with the garage I chose for your list .
"Great service, great price"
Absolutely nothing to fault with the parts of the service provided by [REDACTED].
Great prices great service
So easy to use. Derek at Glasgow sliverburn was fantastic. So friendly and helpful.
"Good price, all went smoothly, chosen fitter quick and efficient"
Great value with local fitment no messing what so ever
easy to deal with. decent prices & now with added fit at your house for only £6 more per visit. Now Event tyres [REDACTED] are my preferred supplier
[REDACTED] tyres. Very easy on-line ordering. Allocated time at selected garage. Arrived on time and left with two tyres fitted within 25 minutes by helpful and friendly staff. Excellent value. Second time used [REDACTED] in a couple of years and service as good on both occasions.
"It’s the first time I have ordered tyres online after reading in autoexpress many times about [REDACTED] so I gave it a go and got my replacement tyre from them at a very good price and found a very good local service centre who fitted it, I would definitely use again and recommend"
Poor communication with emails! Had to call several times and was charged £18.00 in call charges! The cost of the tyres and the phone bill I will receive exceed the price I would of paid if I’d gone direct to the Tyre company so I would not use your service again.
Check your wheel nuts. Quick service Great two post lift so no seal damage with a trolly jack.But once I got home I see one wheel nut sticking out.So I checked all of them to fine that 3 of them had not even been done up.
This is the third time I have used [REDACTED]. They are fantastic. The tyres were delivered on time a d fitted within the alotted time frame by the garage. Excellent work with brilliant prices. Thankyou
OK but. Swapping tyres was fine but all wheels left dirty.
"Excellent service at a competitive price. With a bit of unfortunate in the process, but the tyres did manage to arrive on time as required. Mr Q was very helpful and the customer waiting area is better than expected."
Tyres. Gd price and service
"Easy ordering, quick delivery, and efficient fitting at a great price."
"Total lack of customer services would not use again. Total lack of customer services, Dont return phone calls when say they would, don’t reply to emails messed me around with the fitting dates. Would not use again"
Michelin Pilot Sport 4. Very quick and easy. Delivered the tyres to my closet garage which was ideal.
back again. Used [REDACTED] again as they provide competitive prices and several choices of fitting centres.
I got the tyres I wanted at the cheapest price I could find and I was offered a range of fitting stations to choose from
needed to cancel order as car failed mot and scrapped no problem getting refund for tyre that was due to be fitted
Easy to select tyres - sent to a garage that was friendly and quick service
"Really easy to use Website and Set up the fitting. Really easy to use and set-up, no issues when arriving at the garage to fit, second time I’ve used [REDACTED] and would definitely recommend."
"[REDACTED] was easy to use on the website - type in your car and it tells you the tyres you need, even on the transferred plate. The price was good, the garage was close and the time was quick."
"Excellent price, good choice of garages and trouble free prompt fitting, with no wait."
"Would use again, painless to order & choose a garage to fit the tyres. I was then given a day & time slot to have my tyres fitted. The garage didn't keep me waiting, they started to fit my tyres immediately. They were polite & very efficient. Extremely happy with the service I received."
"Easy and cheap. Easy, efficient and cheap"
Efficient and economic service. This efficient and economic service is a real find and I shall use them for all our tyre needs in the future I believe.
"Excellent service from both the website and the garage used. Barthwick Tyres in Poole, Dorset."
Excellent customer service
"Great prices, fantastic custoner service"
"Easy to use web site, good selection, good prices."
Really pleased with prompt and efficient service. No issues. Great quality.
"Quick, efficient service from [REDACTED] and the garage my tyres wee sent to for fitting were excellent!"
The online purchase was easy & efficient. Not so the fitting.
"My tyre was delayed by 2 days which was fine no issue with that, but I was rebooked in by yourselves- had my confirmation email, but when I turned up to the garage they had me booked in the day before but I was not notified which meant I had to leave getting my tyre changed for a further 3 days"
"Original booking slot ended up not being available, despite being available when booking. Emailed for an alternative that was available online but ended up phoning BC when there was no response. Eventual slot wasn’t ideal and I had to rearrange a few things to make it work. It seems that the slots on the website are not actually all available. But you don’t know this until you book."
Initial online booking not availableThe original booking made online turned out to be not available with the garage booked but the next best available slot was automatically arranged. [REDACTED] kept me well informed and the rest of the booking went without any issues. Would recommend to anyone and will certainly use again.
"Very good service at Birch-MAS garage in Melton Mowbray. I ordered two tyres from [REDACTED] at a good price. I turned up at the garage with no set time for the appointment but both were fitted within 30 minutes and I was good to go. No nonsense, no trying to sell me anything else. I wanted two new tryes fitted and that's exactly what I got in a minimum of time."
Great service from [REDACTED].A straight forward transaction.Kept up to date all the time.Good service at the garage.They could have given the rims a quick wipe over to compliment the tyres.Hence a 9.
"All good here, tyres done in the time chosen, no problem."
"Great All Round. Great Price! Great Service! And local garage, Winsford MOT Centre, Great too!"
"Your partner ""Formula One"" who fitted my tyres scratched my rim, didn't fill the air upto to the standard and took more time to replace the tyres."
Really convenient to order and book a time slot. Fitters really efficient. Met my expectations.
Was quoted an unbelievable price to remove lock nuts at £40 a tyre. I refused and contacted [REDACTED] after wards. I looked for an alternative booking as I was able to remove the lock nuts. No responses from customer service even though I emailed delay for an update. Finally have received confirmation that my refund will be in my account in 3 to 5 days basically delaying the whole process by 7 day of no responses and 5 days refund which is nearly two weeks. If customer services had kept me Informed I wouldn't have needed to be refunded as I was happy to have my tyres fitted after I removed the lock nuts but again no responce meant I was left with no other action. Its a shame as I had used [REDACTED] previously and was happy with the service I received.
"Very polite, friendly and professional reception staff. Quick and efficient service. Highly recommended"
Horrible customer service and high prices
Didn't have any problems with either ordering or having the tyres fitted.
Easy to buy tyres online. Convenient location for fitting. The technician who actually fitted the tyres was friendly and did a good job.
"great value for money fitted on time have used before and will be using again soon,why go anywhere else? thanks."
Easy to book and appears good value
"Decent. Tyres seem a fair price, website decent and easy to use but was let down by the approved garage that fitted them not balancing them after. Contacted [REDACTED], explained my situation and they offered to refund the cost of getting them balanced elsewhere. Can’t moan at that."
[REDACTED] seemed to be the only supplier that had the particular Hankook Kinergy Eco tyres that I wanted for my Ford Galaxy and ordering on line was easy and price good. Formula One fitted no problem. Don’t give 5 stars sorry.
Reliable and convenient. This is the 3rd time I have used [REDACTED] and find them the most competitive. Also like the courtesy phone call to confirm arrival time day before.
Great service. Good service at reasonable pricing and plenty of fitting centres.
"Good all in price, easy to use, choice of garages to have the work done at a time you want."
"Cheaper alternative to tyre dealers. Decent value, convenient fitting, no problems!"
"Useless wont use again. Ordered tyres online for mobile fitting. Day before fitting is due they email to say the tyres haven't shipped and they can't fit tomorrow. They suggest a week later for fitting - pretty useless when riding on a temp spare. Ordered two Michelin tyres and they are owned by Michelin - terrible customer service via email and phone, they screw up and not sorry at all for their mistakes."
Very polite and nice customer service😊
"Very efficient!Good price,and well fitted plus Tyre check."
"A good seamless service convenient and professional, good quality at a competitive price"
"Not sure the ""quality choice tyre"" I received is that ""quality"""
Why not... Super easy and good value
Great service and free coffee
"Avoid [REDACTED]. I was charged an additional £150 by the ""premium partner"" as they had difficulty releasing two locking wheel nuts. This is a job that would have taken any competent mechanic less than 20 minutes. My advice is to go to a regular tyre fitting company."
Excellent service highly recommend. The tyres was fitted on time exactly which is rarely to happen anywhere else.Good team and very competitive price.
Easy order and service both from the website and the shop
"[REDACTED] Avon tyres ats euromaster. great selection of tyres, excellent all inclusive price,convenient fitting centre that for once DID not try to advise me that i needed alignment,or have weeping dampers or brake pads and discs,I will be using again for my other vehicles,and recommending to my friends thank you RD,"
I've never had my tyres changed before and the service was super quick and easy. I was expecting it to take an hour at least but it barely took 10 minutes. Thanks again!
"No surprises. Purchased 4 tyres for my wife and my cars. Picked a local dealer, turned up, done. Brilliant service."
There was a good selection of tyres across all budgets and it was easy to book the fitting at a local company. Will use again.
"I was not sure about buying tyres on the internet, however it was so simple, the appointment was booked tyres arrived, fitted, balanced and I was on my way quickly. Great service."
"I had to have contact with the team for reorganising my appointment, after a mix up (from my side) with appointments, they couldn’t have been more helpful"
Excellent customer service and very easy to use. Will always recommend them for anyone needing new tyres
Very easy and you can save some money and research the tyres. You also have customer reviews to help decide which brand to purchase.
Used [REDACTED] three times now always been very happy with service you and HIQ Dukinfield have provided.
Very good quality good handling on the road. Would recommend
"Staff helpful, they were careful not to scratch alloys"
Easy to choose tyres and fitting
"Best service, unbeatable price and awesome customer service :))"
PoorGot a good priceOriginal time offered and accepted by myself was not honoured as it was a week from what was proposed.Date and Venue was changed without conferring.I have asked for a full refund and still haven’t heard back.Not good at all
Good choice of tyres. Easy process from ordering to booking a garage to fit them. Will use again.
Great choice and price of the tyres. Fitted at a choice of garages. Very efficient service I chose ATS. I was recommended by a friend now I will recommend [REDACTED] to others.
Fantastic place to get tyres - [REDACTED].com has a huge selection for different sizes and brands and the website was extremely helpful with helping me choose the right set of tyres for my car and even making arrangements for my tyres to be fitted at a great service centre. I'm very happy with my tyres and will be recommending [REDACTED].com to anyone else looking for a new set of tyres.
[REDACTED] has a fantastic website to go to for a big selection of popular brands for tyres. Also very helpful in assisting customers with finding the right tyre and finding a service centre for tyres to be fitted (or giving mail order options).
"whats not to like. easy to use, quality tyres fitted locally by expert fitters."
Good price. Simple to order on line. Fitted locally in less than half an hour.
Tyre was not delivered to dealer at the agreed date. I wasted a day off work.
"Great serviceGreat savings. Great service, great price, such a simple idea that works!Won’t buy tyres an other way"
"An excellent garage Hi Q at Galgate[REDACTED]. An excellent garage Hi Q at Galgate. Courteous. [REDACTED] were efficient, and at a very reasonable price."
"Quick,easy,great prices, and really good garage network"
Top quality tyrestotally. Top quality tyres.
Outstanding. I got a tyre from [REDACTED] went to ats aigburth rd fantastic service staff was very friendly an looked after me deffo use again thank you
[REDACTED] web site easy to follow and Budget Auto Centre in Saltburn excellent service in fitting tyres.
"All good. Good tyres, good service"
The [REDACTED] website was easy to use and the four tyres a good price. The only problem was the garage had very little parking space to leave your car safely and to much work. The garage staff were friendly and very helpful.
Very easy way to buy book and fit tyre's. Good service from the garage fast and friendly definitely recomend!!!
"Excellent work No problems. Got my tyres changed, all 4. Delivered no issues and was done in 45 minutes."
Great service. Fast service. The mobile fitter was friendly and very good at making contact. He was in and out in no time.
"A good choice of tyres in the size required and at a range of prices to suit all pockets. A good choice of local tyre fitters, as well. Kept me well informed re: purchase and subsequent arrangements for getting the tyres fitted. A painless process from start to finish."
Never let me down yet.Very convenient and fairly priced.
"Quick, easy to arrange and professional service. Would use again"
On time friendly service. Fitted tires at my work site.
Great if you want to wait 3 weeks. Have been trying to book in my tyre repair for weeks. Incredibly slow to respond. Originally I booked the tyre fitting on a Tuesday for the Saturday morning. They waited until just before 6pm on the Friday to let me know they actually can't do it on the Saturday. Have been going back and forth for two weeks. Asked if they can do the following Saturday to which they said we only have time on Monday. Ended up just calling the garage like you either have the tyre or not? The garage said yeah no problem we can do it Saturday? So let's wait and see what happens. Avoid like the plague.
"Very good prices, delivery as stated and fitted when scheduled. all round cannot be faulted."
"If you want cheap tyres and terrible service this is for you. What an utter disappointment. Ordered Tyres to the local fitter on the 2nd of August for fitting on the the 7th. Money taken on the 2nd. On the 6th I get an email at 15:45 that there is an issue with delivery and I need to rearrange the fitting time and day. As I don't constantly look at my emails I only saw this mail after 6pm when I could not phone them. Phone them the next day, waited 10 minutes before I was answered and apologised to me saying that I can get them fitted on Friday at the same time as my Wednesday appointment had been. Friday comes and I get to the fitter who tells me that they have only had 3 tyres delivered of the 4 I ordered and paid for. I ended up having the three fitted and left the best one of the previous 4 on. I phoned them whilst I was at the fitter. They apologised again and said that they will refund the 4th tyre, Give me £20 off and also a 10% voucher for when next I use them. Of course that was just to fob me off and I only received the refund for the tyre. Not a happy customer and will rather pay more per tyre at another provider than get messed around by this rather unimpressive outfit."
Easy to purchase and to choose a fitting location. Only concern is that the wheels were not torqued to anywhere near the required torque for my car.
"[REDACTED] were great for tyres and I have used them and recommended them for many years but my last purchase was a nightmare. BEWARE trying to communicate with the customer services department of this company is a total nightmare. After a frustrating hour spent calling their Customer Services Office I finally spoke to someone who abruptly said I can't help, you need to speak to Sales, I will transfer you..........another 30 minutes passed and my call was not answered and in frustration I hung up. I tried calling again later but again my call was in a queue and not answered. What a shame this company has forgotten the need to speak to their customers."
"Prices great, fitting done quickly. Only negative was I was not given a choice of a time slot for fitting. I was told 8am when a choice of sat 8am, 9am or 10am would have been helpful."
Great price. Will use again.
"Easy to buy, no fuss, job done on time as arranged, Happy with the Price. Flexible approach by the fitter."
"Good service, didn’t have to wait to long."
Great prices & great service. Will certainly use again
"i chse [REDACTED] because of the price. Also drive straight into the garage no hassle tyres fitted and out with in half an hour, no queuing up."
Good choice of tyres at a competitive price. Easy to arrange fitting at a local depot.
Excellent garage with friendly staff. The whole experience couldn’t have been easier.
"Good value, good service, worked well"
Easy to order online and staff at locus were very efficient and friendly. Will use again.
"Ease of ordering, choice of fitting location, competitive pricing"
Excellent derive by garage and tyres were very competitively priced . Would recommend
Excellent quality tyre. Good email link Would definitely recommend
"They were dearer than Kwik fit by £10.28,(186.68 compared to £176.40). That was me not doing my homework and checking out more competitors."
Everything went well & it was fitted quickly.
Not so good an experience this time price ok garage not so good worst out of 3 times i have used [REDACTED]
good customer service at b/circles and garage of fitment
Time slot not available after ordering
Prices were great but I chose the wrong garage. 55 minutes to fit two front tyres was a joke.It wasn't as if the guy was stopping to talk or going outside for a cigarette. He was just SLOW. I could've changed one tyre using spoons in that time.Happy to use [REDACTED] again but will be using a different garage.
"Went very well, would definitely recommend, they sent me to a local garage and they were excellent, tried Asdatyres previously and had an horrendous result with them."
"Simple & easy to arrange, quick, friendly & efficient service from Tudor services each time I've used them &very good prices."
Price and easy fitting
Got what I ordered in a reasonable space of time in a professional manner. Price was good.
[REDACTED] tyres saved me a lot of money but the service from Savoy tyres in willerby was less than satisfactory. I bought 2 tyres. 1 for the front left and 1 for the rear left but I wanted the new tyre to be fitted to the original wheel and then fitted. They wanted to charge an extra £10 for doing that. They finally agreed not to charge me extra so I asked about tracking but they would only do that if i replaced both front tyres and they would charge extra for that on top of the normal price for tracking. I declined that and went else where for the tracking. There was a young boy changing the tyres who moved so slow and kept yawning.
"Great service. Order online (user friendly website and good selection of tyre brands), make an appointment, show up and done-and-dusted within an hour.Have used BC several times with the Tweeddale garage in Peebles and they have been perfect each time."
Great Value and Service. Best price on the tyres required after shopping around and really efficient fitting service at one of my local garages. Great value and service. Would thoroughly recommend using [REDACTED].com.
good prices and excellent service when fitting tyre - will use again.
Simple process. Very efficient Good price and a wide choice of tyres.
Hassle free and not badly priced
Easy process from start to finish.
"I reviewed the garage used for my last fitting. My experience was not good. However, no one has contacted me following my review"
Unbeatable price!
Prices are competitive and the ordering process is straightforward. Being given a choice of fitters is handy. I choose one that I know is usually quiet so the work is normally done quickly.
Very competitive and great service
really straightforward ordering with clear info about tyre ratings and good user reviews- hassle free fitting from local tyre shop and of course excellent price point
Great prices and excellent service
The chaps at ats were fabulous
Good service and competitive prices
"Good service, good price"
"Plenty of options for buying tyres, good value."
"Good price on tyres, fitted at a convenient location."
Easy.Good price. Helpful service
Used [REDACTED] before due to price and being able to book the car in on line at a time that fits in around my plans
"The process was painless, all staff involved were personable and knew what they were doing and cared about their work, plus saved nearly £200 over other tyre retailers"
"VFM, ease of ordering"
"Ease of use, good price. Only issue is that the slot I booked online turned out not to be available but the communication around that was fine too.."
Prices are good but not always the cheapest so best to shop around
It was a nightmare to book. Had email advising couldn't do original date offering alternative then had to chase and lost that alternative.
The tyres I wanted. A good price. A convenient location. No waiting. And a great job.
"Only reason for not assigning 10 was that garage was unable to reserve time slot (other than am/pm); however, I was greeted by name, work on my car commenced immediately, and job was done to my complete satisfaction. Tyres ( Yokohama BluEarth-A AE50 235/50 R17 W (96)) were competitively priced and offered better fuel economy than many competing brands while still affording A-rated wet grip and 70dB."
Good price and quick response
Easy website Value fir money
Got messed about by the garage
"The online aspect - order and scheduling the fit was easy to navigate. My chosen fitting centre provided an attentive, speedy and personable service. Would I use [REDACTED] and selected fitters again - absolutely - first class service all round!!"
"Brilliant service! Acceptable prices, especially when you buy a full set of tyres. Both the garages I have been directed to use have been very good indeed."
"Simple, straightforward, easy to use website, good prices - what’s not to like !"
Very easy efficient process and the tyre fitting was complete within 30 minutes
The website was simple and easy to use and the prices were the best.
Easy to do online. Reliable. At a time that’s convenient and good price.
Always excellent service and easy to use website
"Attractive price for tyre, seem less selection of local fitting on a timely basis. Great end to end service"
I was very impressed with the efficient service and prices. Not a full 10 as a local independant was cheaper by a couple of pounds per tyre but was not as convenient to get to for fitting.
Recommendation from family member
Very easy and the service was as expected
[REDACTED] are very good the supply system is quick and prices are also good
Fitting Service Centre beyound awful.
Appointment time was changed.
Price and professionalism of service.
Easy to use website and book locally Good range and prices
"Good price, excellent fitters (Chase Tyres) and easy to order."
"Easy purchase, excellent garage"
When I arrived to have my tyres fitted the garage we're not expecting me. After hunting around for my paperwork they did find my booking and said that [REDACTED] had booked me and another person in at the same time but that they only had one tyre fitter so I'd have to wait. It took over an hour for them to fit two tyres on my car.
Good prices and easy to arrange for fitment
"Garage I went to fit tyres didn't balance my wheels properly, I gone abroad next day with family and car was shaking so badly that I had to stop in Germany and I spend 300 Euro to get it right."
Value for money and convenient to book fitting online
"Competitive prices, great communication and plenty of local trustworthy garages to choose from. I will use again & again 👍🏻"
Really easy way to buy tyres & get them fitted at a location & time easy for you.
Very poor service from the fitting dealer.
Much more expensive than last time And have sent me this survey twice
[REDACTED] have an extensive range of tyres to suit every budget and the website is easy to use.
Best price I could get for tyres.
"A quick, easy and cost effective way to buy tyres."
"Ease of ordering, good price, easy to get to fitting location of my choice. Hassle free. Thanks.👍🏻"
Good price and flexible with deliveries
"Good tyres at a reasonable price, easy to use would definitely use again"
"easy online booking, garages that were close by, tyres ordered into garage, able to chose a date/time"
Speed of service and huge choice of products.
"Extremely quick and easy to book online, ATS weregreat, super quick and friendly, would definitely recommend"
All round great service and great price
Easy to use website. First class service and delivery on time
Excellent value for money. Efficient processing of order. Convenient that the tyre was fitted at my local ATS
Great prices and very easy to use service.
"good service and competitive prices, 10/10"
Used [REDACTED] on previous purchases.always good price.
"Great pricing, and a excellent range to choose from. Found a local garage to fit them, at at convenient time. Had absolutely no problems. Website is easy to navigate and payment steps were nice and simple. 10/10."
It was easy to order the tyres i wanted and to choose where i had them fitted
"I've had two bad experiences with the wrong tyres being sent for my car (with which your website only gave me the option for two types of tyres neither of which were right), embarrassment to myself, time wasting for the garages and inconveniencing myself and my family."
Service was what it said on the tin On time and terrific with ATS going the extra mile by repairing my damaged wheel rim when they needn’t have.My car is new and they wanted it to still look so
Helpful and friendly without being pushy.
what a great service and good pricing for my tyres. I have and will continue to advise people of your service. MotorTechs were a great bunch of guys at Temple Farm Southend.
Everything was so simple from ordering to getting the product fitted.
Price & the fact I’d used you before.
"Apart from being the cheapest place to purchase high quality, top branded tyres on the internet, BC customer service is excellent. I had a problem with an incorrect order. This was settled amicably, quickly and with a suitable compensation as a gesture of goodwill."
"Easy to use website, good prices, choice of local garages"
Tyres were delivered 4 days late. Massive inconvenience for me with my car out of use.
Bit disappointed no time was given for appointment. Had to go and wait to be taken.
Failed to meet the promised delivery date. Then failed to make the revised delivery date.
Easy process to find the right tyres at a great price
"In discussions over tyres, I always recommend [REDACTED] as an option worth checking due to the price."
I was quoted a huge figure for my Michelin tyres by a garage so I googled them. [REDACTED] price was almost £100 cheaper per tyre! Simple and easy to use. I'm delighted.
"Price was good but the time I booked for was cancelled and emails didn't resolve anything or get me another booking, the advisor I spoke to was really good and sorted everything however it shouldn't have had to get to that point"
"Good choice on the website, and efficient delivery and fitting process in conjunction with our local garage."
"Unbeatable prices, unable to find a better deal elsewhere."
Easy to use and book-in for
"The centre offered to me was awful- nothing wrong with [REDACTED] in particular, but would make me question using the website due to the location options"
"Very good value, convenience."
"Easy to use website, good info provided by my garage of choice for fitting time, turned up, tyres fitted in half an hour. Very happy, thank you."
cheap and can make appointment
"I have used [REDACTED] for years. Good pricing, excellent service, staff are very professional and friendly. Simple online service to use. Never had any issues."
The fitter was very abrupt so wouldn’t necessarily pick this particular garage again
Very satisfied with the buying process and the service at the garage where the tyres were fitted.
Ordering was straightforward and fitting Centre more than helpful and efficient!
Excellent service and much cheaper than quote from dealer for exact same tyres
Very easy to use and great service was provided by ATS.
Does what it says. Ready to fit quite quickly. Price competitive even if not cheapest
Very helpful lady - Amy
Easy and very competitive system
easy to arrange
"Good price and service, well happy. Good job"
It is very easy to find the right tyres for your vehicle just by providing the registration details. There is a variety of garages to choose from when making a booking and also finding a time which suits the customer
Easy to use website & a very good price on my tyres
Price and local service Excellent.
"[REDACTED] was recommended to me by a friend and I've been very pleased with the tyres I bought. They were fitted for me at my home, for a very reasonable price. I would buy from them again."
Excellent service on time. Though took over 2 hours to change 4 tyres.
No fuss. Great service. Got it done at my local garage.
Prices are good. Delivery is quick. Website is easy to use
Grear prices and tyres fitted within walking distance of my place of work
"Good Prices, convenient fitting points."
"It was quick, cheap & easy"
Initially you stated 2 to 3 days to supply my special tyre. You managed to find a local dealer who had the right tyre and I was back on the road in 5 hours
"It was easy, quick and cheap to get tyres. The garage was amazing. Highly recommended."
Always have the right product at the right price. This is the 3rd time I have used [REDACTED] and wont be the last.
The garage in Didcot was poor!
Very Poor service from the designated engineers (Formula 1)
Usually one of the best prices. [REDACTED] does what it says-only the cheaper tyres are not identified when you buy them-just the specification.
Could not fault service or the price!
"Great service, very competitive prices, good communication with regards to booking confirmation and reminders of the upcoming booking."
Competitive prices and local fitting. Feel 50 minutes to fit two tyres took too long though.
Local fitting agent quite slow.
"Good selection of tyres, reasonable price, good options for fitting location."
Very pleasant and efficient . Great value for money
Good price for the tyres and professional fitting
There are often cheaper services available
"Good price, service and quality."
"Good prices, easy to navigate website."
Good service reasonable prices
Great customer service and easy to use
"[REDACTED] make ordering tyres easy. They tell you the size of tyre your vehicle requires and the capabilities of each brand of tyre as well as giving a good price, inclusive of fitting, balancing and disposing of your old tyres.They inform you of several fitting depots close to your home and their staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.I would not hesitate to use them again."
"Not very impressed with [REDACTED] wont use again. Not very impressed with [REDACTED], won't be using them again. To be fair the mobile fitter (Wiltshire Tyres) was the main problem. Was lied to twice that they would-be fitted in the morning, then I got the usual we don't have the tyres yet phone call rubbish!Called [REDACTED] who promised that he did have the tyres and they would be done in the AM slot.But of course, he never showed in the morning.Called [REDACTED] many times to complain, emails sent and an automatic call back left.....never heard from them again.Poor customer service, unreliable fitter.2 days on since their response they never did contact me again...all talk no action!"
The garage could not honour the booking time. Why does your website offer such slots if they don’t exist. The garage had my car all day as a result.
You did everything you said you would tyres were good value appointment was on time friendly service couldn't ask for more
Bunch of money grabbers. I recently parked outside my local waste disposal tip (as a good citizen) only to get an immediate and fast puncture on my front nearside wheel on the sidewall. Knowing full well I couldn't get a repair to a sidewall puncture I accepted and mentally took on an unexpected and very expensive replacement tyre thru topcashback.co.uk and found [REDACTED]. I've just heard this morning that [REDACTED] has rejected my claim despite my clicking thru topcashback and despite my paying FULL price.
"I just find the whole process very easy to do, I can get very good priced tyres, then just have them delivered to my nearest [REDACTED] fitting service centre ( 5 minutes from my home), book a slot ( normally within a day or so) then 30 minutes & they are done & on my car. What’s not to like 😊"
excellent service eventually as could not be fitted in at my choice of fitter. Had to pay a bit extra to move tyres round car but this was not a problem
Because [REDACTED] provides a wider choice of tyres than the local atseuromaster and yet I can still have these tyres supplied by [REDACTED] fitted by my local atseuromaster. A win win situation.
Really friendly and trustworthy service. I ordered the wrong tyre but [REDACTED] notified me of this and helped me change it. Then the tyre was not needed as the garage could repair the puncture. [REDACTED] collected the tyre and refunded me without any fuss.
"Fantastic, quick no big sales chat, customer service are amazing, no issues they just sort it. I have used a few times now"
The cost of the tyres is very competative however the customer service is excellent. I had an issue and the way your customer service dept dealt with it was exceptional. Thank you
Confusion as to status of order - duplicated order need to be sorted out but
Excellent service and communication with us as customers.
Very nice customer service😊
"Initial purchasing experience was fine. There was an issue with the fitting date (the mobile fitter couldn't make the date I selected) but I communicated with Rajesh and then Bihan to get a different date agreed. That was all fine however once the fitter had completed everything and was about to leave, he told me that he couldn't balance the tyres as he didn't have the necessary fitment for my wheels. I contacted [REDACTED] customer service by email to try and resolve this but didn't get a reply, meaning I had to take my car to a separate service centre and pay an additional £38 to get the four wheels balance. My overall impression is that [REDACTED] are good to communicate with (prompt and polite) prior to the sale, but follow up service, at least in my case, was non existent."
"Good price and staff at ATS were great but [REDACTED] did not inform me that ATS couldn't meet the slotted time of 1000 and had booked me in for 1400 instead. Poor communication and customer service [REDACTED], shame on you!"
"Trouble free from choosing to fitting. This was my 1st experience in buying tyres online and I have to say I'm totally pleased that I chose [REDACTED].The process of comparing, choosing and reading up about the tyres in my size and price range is very helpful and simple to do. They have several top Brands and a large overall choice.And that also goes for choosing the garage and appointment time/date that suits me.You chose the garage and your chosen tyres will be there waiting for you when you arrive. Supply them the order number and abit of information like which tyres you want replacing etc and then sit back and they'll deal with everything. You can leave a review of the garage afterwards to help others decide.You can even copy the appointment info straight into the calendar which is a nice touch. The app links to mapping services to direct you to the garage.If the garage offers other services you can order these aswell, but if there's a charge then you will have to pay that direct to the garage while there.The customer service is 1st class over the phone and in web chat forms.The phone app was recommended to me and I'll certainly be recommending it to other people I know who can benefit from the service.Prices are competitive and I found them to be cheaper than the majority of the market and knowing that the price I pay includes fitting and VAT means I don't need to separately pay the garage aswell.If you don't require fitting then for a reduced price they will deliver the tyres straight to an alternative address.If you need to cancel your order for any reason then they don't question it or try to convince you not to. They simply issue a full refund. No pressure at all. Easy.My experience with [REDACTED] was excellent. I will be using the service next time I require tyre services.Takes the worry out of searching, buying and arranging fittings!"
"Competitive online prices. Rodney's Garage in Forest Hill done an ace job! Superb customer service, quick and flexible. Product and service recommended and will use again."
Excellent service. I just key in my reg number and the appropriate tyre choices for my make and model pop up (this appears to be a relatively new feature) . Before I would need to check my tyres for the tyre model. The prices are competitive and I got to book this in at a suitable time at one of my local garages who were also excellent. This website is helping me to keep the cost of my new tyres right down.
"I got the tyres I wanted fitted at home at a good price. However they changed the time and date slot that I chose when I booked online and only told me by email which I don't check too often. The work was done by a seemingly new and inexperienced lad. He worked hard though, kudos to him. Price is good, especially for a mobile service."
"Great service, arrived on time and tyres fitted no problems."
had a problem - they corrected it promptly
Great affordable tyres & fitted at a time that suited me & was convenient.
Good service and great tyres. Only issue is 5t he first booking got put back. I don't understand why there is an option to book an appointment if its not available. Other than that great service.
Local fitters next day delivery and competitive pricing
[REDACTED] itself good value easy to use but the so called premier garage they use fitted my tyres and they were terrible wheel shook stupidly second attempt same issue slightly improved but still noticeable shaking went to a other more regular garage I use rebalanced and smooth as ever
"No waiting for garage to order in tyres. Easy to arrange date for tyres to be fitted locally. Great website, will use again."
"smooth ordering process, good prices"
good price and efficient service
Competitive pricing - 10% off flash sale made me purchase with [REDACTED].
Easy and price
Ordering and booking couldn't be easier. So very convenient. The whole process was quick and simple. The staff at Cavendish Motors were very professional and the work was completed in a timely manner. I have used [REDACTED] and Cavendish Motors before and wouldn't hesitate to do so again in the future.
Good value and fitted on time
"I don’t have much spare time so used [REDACTED] as they already had good reviews and competitive pricing. The whole transaction was speedy and hassle free. I liked the fact that a local fitter attended to fit the tyres and offered a very efficient service. Will definitely come back again, no need to look elsewhere."
"[REDACTED] identified the size of tyre required for my vehicle and it was very easy to order them. They told me there were several fitting depots close to my home and [REDACTED] staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The prices were good and a description of the capabilities of each tyre were given. I don't think the service could be bettered."
"The staff in Milton Keynes were great, they were young but really took an interest in making sure the customer was happy with the work. They took time to explain what they were doing if asked, well done to those two."
Easy to use and couldn't fault the service provided by the garage that fitted the tyres!
"Good prices, excellent service at garage. Easy to use web-site."
Because this is the second time this year I have been let down with a fitting date. You just send new appointments without actually phoning customers to explain
V good service and kept to delivery times
Excellent choice and availability of tyres. Access to plenty of approved garages to fit.
Good selection of tyres. Competative prices.
When I turned up at the arranged appointment time last Saturday the tyre fitter had no record of the appointment. I then had to rearrange my weekend plans and return on the Sunday. I was told that this was the fourth time this had happened to them that week. There is obviously a communication problem between the [REDACTED] booking system and the tyre fitters. I would be unlikely to use the service again after this.
Good price and the fitting garage were good
Most plight and helpful people
"Very fast & efficient plus a lovely cup of tea, what more could you expect."
"The garage we chose from your listing gave us a time. We arrived there but no-one was on the reception desk & nobody came until finally I went out into the bay to request assistance but it was still a long time before anybody came. Finally after being attended to we were told we'd have to wait another 45mins before the tyres could be put on this being despite the fact that we had booked in & arrived on time. When we finally did get the car back, which took longer than (the added) 45 minutes I'd missed important work hours & we almost missed picking up our small daughter from school on time. A week later I drove the car on the motorway & there's an awful wobble when getting close to motorway speeds. This was not there prior to taking the vehicle in. A very unsatisfactory experience from beginning to end. We shall shop for our vehicles elsewhere in future."
excellent value and easy booking system
"Website easy to negotiate , order placed , garage arranged all done , very slick."
Easy to use tyre fitting broker. Easily booked for tyre fitting at my local ATS branch and the price was significantly less than an ATS quote
"Tyretastic. Great Service! Tyres arrived on time, fitted at the agreed time and back on the road within 45 mins after changing all 4 tyres."
"[REDACTED] system works well and can save you money. I've used [REDACTED] twice now and was impressed by their system of supplying tyres to a local garage of your choice for convenient fitting. Usually their price works out at least 10% cheaper but not always, so compare prices and if it looks a good deal you can vou sure that the system works well."
"Precise and cost efficient service, easy to order and collect"
"Used for 5 years, still generally lowest prices for my tyres and faultless service. Recommended"
"Great cost and great service. Great cost, great service!"
Couldn't be easier to buy through [REDACTED]. Tyres are great value and there are lots of options to get them fitted. would definitely recommend.
Excellent service and prices.
"quick, easy, good value. excellent fitting"
great service fitted at a local chain company cheaper than they could provide them. Delivered on time. what's not to like.
Amazing service will use again. Great service! Had a tyre change was £40 cheaper than the other garage I use just over the road!
Efficient service at good price
"Very good service, good pricing and very easy to order."
Very good service and value for money
Got tyres at a great price and fitted a my work. Got tyres at a great price and had the fitted a my place of work. Fantastic and professional service

"Top marks. Cheap, convenient and very easy!"
tyres ordered online and paid for so easy to do Had the tyres fitted at a garage close to home very good service provided by the garage Bond street MotorsExcellent all round experience
"Tyre purchase made simple. A simple, straightforward way of selecting and purchasing tyres at very competitive prices which allows the purchaser to make his or her own selection of the preferred fitting location, date and time."
"Excellent. My tyre was fitted expertly and in a reasonable time, while I waited. Will definitely use again."
"I wanted tyres for a trailer and using [REDACTED] gave me the time and ability to choose exactly what I wanted and fitted by a trusted local company, without being persuaded to have what's in stock. All at an excellent price."
"Fast delivery of tyres. Ordered two Dunlop tyres that arrived a day earlier than expected, which enabled me to have them fitted earlier by my nominated garage.I think the tyres are quieter than the previous Avon and Uniroyal tyres. Thank you!"
"Easy and simple. So easy to use, ordering was simple once everything was confirmed I contacted fitting centre to arrange fitting of tyres, car taken straight away on arrival and was ready at time agreed for pickup"
incredible service at an amazing price. Outstanding value for money.
The use of [REDACTED] was brilliant and the service at garage was fantastic will use again
"Fantastic service and prices, as always.Very easy to use website with a range of fitting stations to chose from.Will continue to use!"
"No problem. No issues select tyre you want, location and timing, pay for it and go"
Such easy process. A great and easy buying process from start to finish. Order online with “fitted” prices and arrived at fitting centre to be welcomed with a smile.4 new tyres fitted in less than an hour.
A good experience. A good choice of tyres on offer at various price ranges. I chose a mid range pair of Avon Tyre's to be fitted at my nearby ATS outlet. Fitment and optional wheel alignment were carried out well with no issues. No problems with TPMS system either.
Easy to book and the garage installed the tires
Fantastic. Great service at best price.
Very good prices for tyres
great service excellent prices. really straightforward website with excellent information on tyre ratings and very interesting user reviews - hassle free fitting at reputable local tyre shop and excellent price point I have used [REDACTED] before and the experience was similarly positive
"Good price, quick mobile service. Recommend"
The treatment of my wife was totally unacceptable as the staff where we had the tyres replaced were extremely rude. I definitely would not recommend this company to anyone!
"Easy way to get tyres, buy online book into garage turn up and sorted. No problems done an dusted"
Excellent quick service and value.
Very competitive price. Considerably cheaper than other local providers. Fitted locally and at a date/time that suited me. Will use again.
"tyres where fitted in no time, they made a great . very pleased."
"A great value set of Michelin Cup 2's tyres fitted on the driveway at home. Great price, great service."
Overall not a bad experience. Fitters arrived promptly and did an excellent job on my driveway....
Easy to select tyres and book a fitting for a couple of days later at a local garage.The local garage had the tyres and fitted them promptly at the agreed date and time.Excellent service all round
"Tyres not at the Garage. I ordered my tyres and booked an install date 5 days after the order was placed, on arriving at the garage they had no record of my order or tyres, after lengthy phone calls the order was located and I had to wait a further 2 days to get my tyres fitted.This is the first time I have had any issues with [REDACTED]."
"A great way to buy your tyres.Easy to select the exact qualities and performance that you're looking for.I've used the online booking service for tyre fitting several times now,it has always worked well"
"Good work. Two front tyres changed - no issues, would definitely use again and recommend."
Easy to organise online good value good tyres and a pleasent time getting them fitted . Enough said.
"Easy transaction, best price, fitted locally at ATS but at lower cost."
Superb price and service
Good price and prompt fitting at home on the caravan.
First time user. Great price and service.
Only delivered three tyres to the garage instead of four resulting in appointment being cancelled along with MOT scheduled on the same date. Everything required to be rearranged causing not inconsiderable inconvenience.Garage was excellent throughout including fitting and communications.
"Booked to have tyres fitted at local garage, but was contacted by [REDACTED] a few days later and told the garage could not do it, [REDACTED] organised a different garage quickly and it was completed ok."
"Happy with the tyres, but booking can be annoying, I booked the day and the time slot that was available online that suited me. Once I paid the money, a day later they email me saying that the day and the time slot is not available. And they offer random day and time that didn't suit me. I wanted to book at a different garage on same day but i couldn't do it due to tyres being send to my first garage choice. If is not available than dont show it on your website [REDACTED]. Thanks"
"Excellent. Good selection of tyres and good prices and service, excellent all round"
"Easy access to website, very good price for tyres"
"Good experience, job done on time and quickly.Staff helpful and friendly."

"price and product very good , just the first come fist served not what I expect"
"Always use [REDACTED] for my tyres. Excellent prices and service , fitted locally by my local garage. With a great choice of tyre makes for all budgets. My local tyre centres can’t beat their prices."
High prices and poor service
"Great product, price and service, the recommended fitting garage in my case was Stanfield Garage and they to were very professional, overall there is no doubt in my mind I will be dealing with [REDACTED] again in the future and will be recommending them to all my friends and accociates."
Good price and good service. What's not to like?
Quick and easy to buy the right tyres and then able to select a local garage and date and time for fitting
Used a few times now with lodge tyres fitting and all’s good on. 275 35 19 which is always a challenge for the fitter
"Easy website to use, competitive prices, convenient garage with friendly helpful service."
Good price for tyres with a good range.Good selection of garages to do the fitHassle free
We got the tyres we wanted fittedi. We got the tyres we wanted fitted locally when we wanted them at a good price compared to other suppliers
Great service. Easy to use service and pleased with the tyres and fitting

"Excellent website, great tyres at best prices."
"Excellent price and service, and the fitting company Tyrewise who fitted the tyres at my house were also excellent, fitted the new 2no rear tyres in 20 minutes, very professional."
"[REDACTED] with a heart in the middle. Excellent service, choice and informative very step of the way until the day you get them fitted. Couldn't be happier after not knowing where to start from a novice at buying tyres."

"Good prices, easy to book appointment"

will use again. good prices and great choice of participating garages. Fantastic service from the garage also
Confident of getting good price. Confident of getting good orice
Excellent service. I recommend [REDACTED] tyres......good value and service.
Used [REDACTED] previously. Same great choice and service this time at reasonable prices.
Great quick friendly knowledgeable service.
"Have used them on 5 or six occasions. The prices are very good-usually the cheapest for specific brands. Their [REDACTED] brand is sold on a specification, not a name so you do not know what you will get.Useful to have a choice of fitting locations. Would recommend."
Good experience overall. Very helpful garage
Why pay more for tyres. Great value tyres and fitted at my local garage....within 5 working days
The only people for me when it comes to tyres . As always with this company. First class service and excellent prices. Another very seamless and professional transaction. Thank you [REDACTED]. 👍
"Superb. I cannot fault the garage that carried out the work at all. The staff were polite and helpful. Once the work was done they showed me what had been done and made some advisory notes for my future awareness. The waiting time was made clear in the confirmation email after I had booked the work but I would say this isn't so clear prior to booking. For me, it wasn't a problem but it is perhaps not clear enough before booking"
Easy to order great price will use them all the time now
"Excellent service. Extensive selection of tyres at reasonable prices. Customer Service was excellent; the garage I originally selected for fitting could not fit me in for my chosen appointment so I was notified immediately and they managed to fit me in at another garage on the same day. Tyres were waiting when I arrived. Very satisfied, will definitely be my first choice next time I need tyres."
Good price and great local garage. Good price. Got tyres I wanted. Local garage were great as it's a well established local business and very professional.
"Always good online prices and the local fitting service (SB Services, Strathaven) is excellent"
Fantastic service and great low cost
"Fast delivery and good selection of fitters. Only problem was that the tyre part numbers for run-flat and non-run-flat tyres was the same, so easy to order the wrong one, as I did. However BC did sort that quickly,"
"Simples. I have used [REDACTED] before, it's so easy.Choose your tyres and then your garage. Easy to negotiate website.I have given 4 stars this time as in the past they have always been best price but this time there were other companies with same prices. Their budget tyres were a good price but I have not bought as not sure if it's a real saving so I stick to brands."
Initial garage choice cancelled as they were busy but [REDACTED] support team very helpful in finding another garage within my stated area and stated time frame.
Still the best. Excellent choice at reasonable prices. Good installation service. Enough said.
"Always good price,"
fuss free service at a great price.

Your website crashed after payment. Called customer services who said the payment had gone through but the booking day and time had not been actioned and I had to rebook my car for another day. Had a confirmation email that night for the original time and date. Went in to ATS and they said it was booked in for 3days later even though I had an email saying it was then. They booked it in the next day. 2 days later I had another email reminding me my car was to go in that day. Your systems just seem disjointed
Seamless purchase and fitting.

"New Tyres fitted. Best priced tyres including fitting for what I wanted to replace, like the ones on my car,Ive purchased from [REDACTED] before and would always recommend them"

"All Good. Fair price, user friendly site, quick fitting"
Brilliant prices and service from garage
"Very Highly Recommended. Really good website, very easy to use. This was the third time i have used [REDACTED], and as usual the tyres were by far the cheapest around (Remember, the price includes fitting, this is usually where garages make their money).This time i opted to pay the extra £6 for the mobile fitter to come to my house. It took him less than 30 minutes to remove, re-fit, and balance 2 rear tyres. Very quick, easy and hassle free. Best £6 i've ever spent.The tyres are brilliant so far, they were the cheapest option available in my size, and they are much better than my old Pirelli tyres. They actually grip the road when it rains!My local garage quoted me £250 for just 1 of their cheapest available tyres fitted.The price from [REDACTED]? £180 for 2 tyres fitted at my house. Its a no brainer!"
Quick and easy buying experience. Easy to choose a selected garage and fitting time

"Tyres sorted. My experience was very good and I will use [REDACTED] again. It’s a simple and easy process making it ones less headache for buying tyres.

"Great prices, good choice."
goog price good fitters
Good value for good quality tyres

The cost of the tyres was an overriding factor.
Very helpful good price nothing to much trouble.
Hassle free tyre change. Easy to organise. Work done on time. Have used a few times now and will certainly use again.
The quickness of my tyres getting to the garage was good and I like the time slot but the garage made a mess of my alloys with the white paste
Great service as ever. Tyres even arrived the previous day to what had been arranged and garage could fit. Good price too
Very good service good price small issue at site over charged but as they had done other work I thought that’s just what it was and paid phoned that night to apologise and quick return of money
"Changed date and time, also tyre I chose.Much, much easier to book direct with garage"
It's a great service but a little expensive and there more offers for multiple (4) tyres.
"Excellent service, and good prices, but I never score 10 as it laves no room for improvement!"
"Great website, easy to navigate, excellent choice of tyres at very reasonable prices. My order was sent directly to my garage which was exactly what I needed as a service was due at the same time so all sorted in the same day"

I found the prices to be better than local providers and [REDACTED] arranged for the tyres to be fitted at a place local and handy for me. My experience was very good. I would recommend them and will use them again in the future.

Have now used Meads of Melksham twice for tyres. As a result of my first visit I also got them to complete my Mot and service. So more than happy
Good service but there are cheaper prices available at a major tyre fitting chain.Also received a confusing change of appointment time text from [REDACTED] the night before the fitting but all turned out ok.
All went to plan and good price
"This was the first time I used [REDACTED], they have a large selection of different manufactured tyres to choose from all at competitive prices which includes fitting. Their business is well organised and keep in contact with you by text messages and email during the purchase and fitting of the tyres. They also have a number of selected partners in all areas of the country, the one I choose was first class very professional once the car was booked in everything was taken care of.Will use [REDACTED] again and would highly recommend them which I have done already.This is an excellent one stop shop no more phoning or driving around for prices."
Brilliant. Competitive prices. Easy to use web site.
"Highly recommend using [REDACTED]. Initial booking and order was straight forward but then I was told, by a polite email, the garage was not able to fit my tyres. I rang [REDACTED] the next day and got a different garage to fit them more quickly. Prices for my tyres, elsewhere,were over £100 each and [REDACTED] saved me £120 for all 4 and they had a better rating (B and C rather than E and E)Very impressed."
Excellent price and EZ installation.
"The discount wasnt done automatically, and ended up paying the extra £20!!"

"The price was great but . The price was great. I was a bit concerned over whether the right tyres had been ordered. The fitters, Harris Bros, said that I should have had a different version of the tyre ordered. Also I have noticed that the fitters check tracking and ask if you need it altered - at a price. I’m not sure if this is the standard price or whether it is a higher price because the service was provided through [REDACTED]. I’m not sure if I would use [REDACTED] again. I will try foing dirwct to the fitters next time."
Excellent service and competitive price.Could not fault [REDACTED] or Mr Tyre.Dealt with by professional and pleasant staff. Clean and comfortable reception area in which to wait.
Brilliant service and at a reasonable price. Fitting was done within the time requested with a good tyre and also friendly staff

"Had all four tyres replaced on 04/07. Four days later one tyre was completely flat and another was getting low. I reached out to [REDACTED] and they quickly put me in touch with the fitters and they had someone out the very next morning to replace them. It was an issue with the valves and they fitted new tyres. [REDACTED] followed up to make sure everything had been sorted. Whilst I obviously would have prefered that the tyres had not been defective, I think the best measure of a company is how they handle it when something goes wrong. I've used them twice now and I was thoroughly impressed with how quickly they got the problem sorted. I highly recommend them."
Great service. No fuss. Tyres fitted at my local preferred garage. Used for the second time. Will recommend.
The only let down was the ATS depot that fitted the tyres as they left the alloy wheel rims smeared in black grease and grime
Highly recommend. The cost ot their tyres is very competive but their customer service is excellent. I was unfortunate to have an issue with the fitting company but the [REDACTED] Cutomer Service Team was exceptional at rectifyng the issue. Would use again and recommend. Thank you
Great prices and quick service. Would buy again.
Excellent choice and great service. Website excellent and choice of tyres ensures I get exactly what I want - at the right price. Used service before and selected budget tyres performed well. Selected garage that fitted also hassle-free.
Good prices poor service. The whole process was fine until I received a call to say the tyres weren’t available on the day that they should have been. One of the advisers didn’t call me back as promised with a new date
"Bought 4 tyres, delivered to garage and put on without any problems. Good quality tyres; could not find cheaper. Highly recommended."

"Great price, sorted quickly. What more could anyone want? Thanks"
The price was the best at the time
I had no problems with [REDACTED] however ATS where the tyres were fitted were a nightmare. They had a lot of able and qualified tyre fitters available but they all appeared to believe this was below them as they were now supervisors so some poor kid ran around trying to do all the work. No-one lifted a finger to help him and it took for than 2.5 hours to get the tyres on my car changed
Great value and hassle-free service
"Easy ordering, local garage, good price"
Simple ordering process and professional fitters
good service and price
The price was good and have no problems.
"Was told to turn up for fitting at 14:30. Got there to be told: “I don’t know why [REDACTED] have given you a time, they shouldn’t have.” Was then told I would have to wait 40 minutes for the fitting, which then turned out to be over an hour. Not impressed seeing as I was doing this on my lunch break and was an hour late back to work. I also had to wait for the man to check that the tyres were actually there, as he said that any deliveries from [REDACTED] were just added to stock and there had been occasions when the tyres had got sold on that were supposed to be reserved for the customer! Thankfully this wasn’t the case for me. There is a clear lack of communication between [REDACTED] and the mechanic used!"
Great website and price. However I feel the F1 auto centre I used tried to sell me extra services that were not needed!
Great prices and worked efficiently

Easy to book and great service from the provider.
Efficient service and a good saving.
Easy to book. Go to local fitting centre & know what you need is in stock.
"Solid experience, good almost everything. The only thing I would say was that it was ahrd to contact the garage itself when I needed to reschedule an appointment, as they were constantly not answering the phone. Got through eventually."
Choice and price
"You didn't deliver on the date requested, how can i recommend?"
"Good choice, price, information, process and service"
"Good choice of tyres, easy booking process, fitter was excellent."

Your booking appointment system needs to be improved. Booked and confirmed with ATS one day - then cancelled. You confirmed an appointment with ATS 3 times at 11.00am the following day then advised by ATS at 10.30am they could not start work on the car until 2.0pm!
"I purchased a complete set of Continental contact 6 tyres for my vehicle last year, I had an accident and damaged beyond repair one of them, I contacted [REDACTED] to order a replacement, my request was dealt with efficiently and professionally with a fitting time and date, this was completed as expected."
"[REDACTED] have an extensive range of tyres to suit every budget, the website is easy to use and the fitting stations are graded according to the services and facilities offered,"
"Not very good service, first late with delivery few time make re booking, I booked to change 2front tyres and ask them to put back on front and new on back, which is normal practice, they a lot of argue with me and change for extra money. In big and good tyre services this is for free. Will never use again this garage again."
"Great value, really easy to arrange and very happy with the service overall."
"Good service, fair pricing and good fitters"
The tyres supplied are if poor quality and an unknown Chinese manufacturer.
Asked for an AM mobile fitting service. Received an email stating it will be upto 1Pm (?). I’m sure AM should mean before 12 The fitter turned up at 2:20.
"Sent to wrong location via SMS the “day of” the job. Booked in time was 1hr later than expected. Requirement to be on-site was wrong, hand no camera. The facility was in the middle of an industrial park, nowhere to go other than the reception room, not designed for 3-4 hour stay."
"Terrible customer service. Rude staff, not pleseant at all."
"Appointment time I chose and was approved , did not match when I got to the garage ... a difference of nearly4 hours"

"ordering process went very smooth, fitting arrangements confirmed by email and appointed garage were very efficient. Good price for tyres and I would use again"
"didn't arrive at time stated, hence i had to stay in all morning. Also my husband, on checking tyres had to replace my wheels trims as they were not fitted back on correctly"
Price and friendly service. Convenient. No oversell
"DisappointingMy review reflects the individual garage that put the tyres on my car. I phoned in advance to give my arrival time and was told it was quiet. I arrived exactly when I said I would and was told it was terribly busy! I waited a total of 1 hour and 45 minutes (the actual fitting time on my car took less than 15 minutes). The waiting room was dingy and dirty, the magazines elderly and torn, the coffee machine was out of cups and coffee pods. I did not try the loo as I was put off by the waiting room. I won't go there again but may try another fitter or the home fitting option. Hard to tell how much I saved as I chose tyres that my previous supplier does not stock; also I always used to get a wheel alignment with them and did not do that at this garage."
Operative was excellent- professional and helpful! Why was there only one person working though? There seemed to be double booking but only one person available.
"Very efficient!When the 1st garage I selected couldn't help, they quickly found another one close by.I can't fault them"
"Having originally booked and paid for my tyre fitting. I received an email from [REDACTED] to advise there booking information wasn’t correct and the garage they had advised could fit my tyre weren’t open on Saturday afternoon. I then called them to rearrange and had to then arrange to be called back the following day. We finally arranged for a mobile tyre fitter to come and fit my tyre on Saturday morning. The fitter never turned up despite repeated calls from me to them to confirm when they would be arriving. They subsequently posted a card through my door on Sunday morning have already been informed I wouldn’t be in which was why I needed the tyre fitting on Saturday morning.They did eventually replace my tyre on Monday. I complained to [REDACTED] who sent me an email offering me a 10% discount on my next purchase through them. This discount will never be used, terrible customer service!"
"I’ve used you a number of times and this time the garage i usually use (ats in kendal) wasn’t an option as I think it’s closed down. So I went for the only garage in kendal on there. This garage was un organised, were not expecting me (even though I rang them to confirm a time) and the wheel balance was poor as the steering wheel shook after and had to get the wheels re balanced when my car was serviced"
Excellent service and very helpful discussion with one of your staff who helped me rearrange the date of the fitting.
Good price and service...
"Very good website, easy to order, quick appointments to get tyres fitted. I phoned about 4 tyre suppliers and [REDACTED] were the cheapest for the 3 Bridgestone run flats that I needed for my BMW. Will certainly use them again and have told friends and family about them too."
"I needed 3 new tyres for my BMW and [REDACTED] were the cheapest, easy website to order the tyres and quick fitting appointments."
Great service. Good price for the tyres.
"Reasonable price and choice.Not sure I got the correct tyres, bad weather will show that. I went by the web site description for all season tyres, but as was pointed out, the tread isn't like ANY other all seasons tyre."
Excellent service ordering tyres online. I’ve used [REDACTED] for the past 5 years and they’ve always been reliable. The local garage were very efficient in fitting the tyres quickly. 5/5.
"A little cheaper buying tyres with [REDACTED] . It's easy and convenient because you can choose local tyre fitters.I had a slight problem with delivery as I ordered 4 tyres only 3 arrived on day of fitting, but within 40 minutes the fourth tyre arrived so slightly concerned as I ordered all four tyres 2 weeks in advance to my fitting day and felt a little let down.Other than that I'm happy with my GOOD YEAR tyres.[REDACTED] need to be more accurate with their deliveries as this can lose the confidence of future customers."
Great price...easy to navigate website...painless arrangement of installation
Always my first option when buying car tyres. Always my first option when needing new tyres for my car. Never have had a bad experience. Lots of communication from the moment you purchase tyres online so you always know what is going on. Have had tyres delivered to local garage for fitting and had mobile fitting also. Both options great and so convenient as you can pick time slots when purchasing. Always great customer service and always good equality tyres. No reservations when recommending [REDACTED] to anyone.
Great service and communication. Tyre fitting at my local centre was as scheduled on my chosen date.
"Easy to use web site, lots of option on fitting sites and price OK."
"Convenient Good Value and Professional Service. Company provide easy ordering, a good choice of fitting location and times. In addition, their prices are generally the best you can find and the fitting franchises are helpful and professional."
The price of tyres was the best i could find.Booking the appointment when suitable to me was so easy.Tyres fitted at said time with no problems.
Always competitively priced and a prompt local fitting service
Even though you had to cancel my tyre appointment due to unforeseen circumstance you re-booked my appointment the next available day and kept me posted all the time. Fantastic communication. Thank you
"My initial booking was delayed, however this was communicated to be in a timely manner and was re-schedules without any issue. The service I had from the selected garage was good. I also saved money using [REDACTED], result!"
"So easy to use, gave me a great choice of places to choose from, easy to book which day you want and a quick to reply with a time."
I have used in the past and have found the prices reasonable.
Had a booking in and got changed last minute so had to move my work around which was extremely frustrating and inconvenient
Cheapest price online for the tyres needed
"Efficient, cost effective service"
Thank you [REDACTED]. Cheapest online price for the tyres I needed with ease of booking for fitting at a local garage. Will definitely be using them again
The garage used was top notch
Tyre fitter did a great job
"Very Competitive Priced tyres ,Excellent Fitting service at A & S Tyres and wheels -Woodford"
"Good service (although I did have to call after 12 to find out where my mobile service was - apparently ""morning"" appointments runs to 1300 with [REDACTED]....would have been good to know.......)"
Very quick and efficient service at the chosen garage.
"Staff are very helpful at A & S ,Well done"

Very good service. Very good and honest service. Very easy to arrange on line.
"I liked the choice of tyre and the information available to make that choice safely and sensibly, with regard to performance in the areas that particularly concerned me, quietness and wet-grip.I also liked the choice of fitter and the flexibility that gave me, when I had to change my timetable at the last minute."
A great service. Easy to find the industrial estate not so easy to find Buntingford Auto Services but when you do you get great polite friendly service. I will definitely be using them again.
Tyre not delivered to fitting company. [REDACTED] told me for half a day it had been delivered before accepting their error.
"Never been for a tyre change where you get a time. Arrived at the correct time, staff told me a time by when the work would be done. Went away, came back at stated time, car waiting to be driven away. Had no waiting around due to in accurate time estimates, no hassle from management trying to sell me additional services. Very happy. Would have been a ten except for late notification of time. Booked tyres early in week and the time noted at buying tyres just said a.m. for the Saturday Checked opening time at garage as 8.30 on the Saturday and arranged day based on getting to garage at 8.30. Was checking phone messages on Sat morning and noticed one from Friday evening confirming the time of 10.00 which messed up previously made arrangements. Can an actual time be given on the date of the tyre purchase rather than waiting until the evening prior to when the work is to be done?"
Quick and easy to use. Found a car garage right beside my work. Very convenient
Excellent service from Wincanton Motor Sport at a very competitive price.
The price was very competitive and the service excellent
Easy and efficient service allowing customers to find competitively priced tyres. Choosing a garage at a date and time convenient to you - will definitely use again.

Top quality convenient professional value for money service. Excellent professional service from [REDACTED] as usual. 3rd time repeat customer. Won’t go anywhere else. Mobile service all very convenient and a job done by somebody who you can trust not to scratch your alloys ! Thanks [REDACTED] !
"Excellent service and price. First time I've used the site. I was a bit sceptical about using them. I ordered the tyres which were massively cheaper and they booked an appointment with the fitters. Really simple to use the site. Tyres were fitted two days later. I'm really happy with [REDACTED], they saved me a huge amount of money. Definitely will be using them again."
"As easy as they say it is, cheapest tyre fitted by the most local garage, in my case a few hundred yards from my house. I phoned the local garage for the same tyres and they quoted 20% more than [REDACTED]."
"Excellent price, communication and service from mobile fitter"
It was easy to order and very straight forward to get to fitting
Ordered and paid to get front tyres for my Mercedes. All booked in with local tyre fitting company. On the day before due to be fitted was told there was an issue and couldn't deliver the tyres. I was due to use my car to go on holiday the next day. When I asked for refund to go elsewhere was told it would take 3-5 days so was out of pocket and had to pay Someone else to do the tyres. Terrible service
Great service from Tudor Car services .The car was dropped off and the work was completed very swiftly.I would 100% recommend Back Circle Tyres
Wouldn't use again as the garage I got it fitted said the tyre was rubbish and could have had a better tyre fitted for the same price
"Ist Class Tyre Service. Excellent, Quality tyres at Good Prices with plenty of choice. Flexibility to chose your fitting provider and select your fitting date, all done from your armchair!!"

"Excellent service ,Great price ,Fitting service Brilliant, Have been using [REDACTED] for years,Never Let me Down ."
"A good price delivered and fitted on time, easy to order what’s not to like."
"Mcconnachys who fit the tyres are great as always. Slightly disappointed with [REDACTED] only in booking a time slot to be later told that they couldn't fulfil it and had to wait an extra week. Small things, but I can get past the frustration given the saving."
"Awesome price service. Awesome price, excellent service, I had them fitted at a local tyre shop. Had to wait for the tyre to come into stock but well worth the wait. You have a customer for life!"
my tyres were ordered for the Monday. it got cancelled to the Tuesday. cancelled to the Wednesday. I was going on holiday on the Saturday and desperately needed the tyre done for the long journey. I had no real explanation as to why it was 're arranged so much
"Great prices, very easy to find the correct tyres and arrange the fitting"
A good selection of tyres at very competitive prices plus a very good group of fitting outlets.
Excellent price and mobile fitting service
"Chose to have my tire's fitted by a mobile fitter.He turned up on time, and did a great job.The process of choosing and purchasing the tires was great too."
"Everthing went smoothly nice friendly staff, didn't wait too long easy to follow website no complaints about anything."
"good tyres nice and simple. Simple buying process, with good service, and great prices, what more could you ask for.I had these tyres fitted at ats, but bought through [REDACTED], meaning that the tyres were ~25% cheaper than buying from ats... Same staff, same service, just a couple of days wait.These tyres seem to handle everything I have asked of them. They seem nice and quiet, tyre life is yet to be seen"
"I have ordered with fitting in Ats euro master in Llandudno. I am happy with tyres but not with service. My alloy wheels been damaged and one of wheel cap came off straight away after change tyres. Staff said it was already broken, what I don't belive because before change I haven't got any problem with them. Anyway tyres Brighstone turanza are very good, highly recommend."
Doesnt Get Any Better. Used [REDACTED] for some years and still they're competitive as ever.Convenient fitting by appointment at a local garage of the top brands at rational prices. Not sure how they could improve their offering it's pretty much as good as it can get.
Best price I could find for a branded tyre
"Easy to order, good choices, local fitting garage."
A wide choice of tyres to choose from and I every price range. Couldn’t be easier
Amazing customer service. Had a puncture on a run flat tyre that I bought with them 6 weeks prior. No warranty on the tyre but the guy in sales was amazing and understood the difficulty. Helped me get a price on the same tyre that didn’t break the bank.
"[REDACTED] tyres are an excellent andhappy customer good prices. [REDACTED] tyres are an excellent and affordable price that the every day man can afford. I have always used [REDACTED] for my tyres, the fitting service that they use are professional and knowledgeable people"
"I’ve made a complaint and despite receiving an automated response to say that you will respond with an acknowledgment within one working day, you have failed to do so. In view of my initial complaint plus the fact that you’re unable to keep your promises with regards to the complaints procedure I would not recommend your company."
"Waiting Game. Artived at the ATS garage on time for my alloted 4pm appointment, bearing in mind you need to be there 5 minutes before. I waited 3/4 of an hour and they finally fitted my tyres, which took another 30 minutes. Why bother scheduling an appointment if they just keep you waiting for almost an hour?!?"
I got a puncture that could not be repaired on a run flat tyre. 4 new tyres had just been bought and the guy I spoke to in sales was really amazing and truely understanding of my issue.
"Was originally quoted I would have the tyre fitted on the 9th August, wasn’t fitted until the 13th. If the tyre wasn’t Available until the 13th, if I knew this when I purchased it this would not have been an issue."
"The best tyres, at discount prices!"
Very good site and prices but some non-technically/mechanically minded folks may find the process daunting simply due to change
"The entire transaction was smooth and efficient. Good value, too!"
"Competitive prices, easy to book and find a local garage"
Excellent customer service from SK8 tyres. Despite me losing the locking wheel nut key.
"Good price and excellent service, with the tyres fitted when you want without having to hang around."
Poor service from garage. second time buying tyres and the experience this time was not as good. Ordering online all fine but garage failed to change tyres in the morning even though I had specified a morning time slot. I had something planned for the afternoon and needed to be on the road. Garage just provided excuses about being unusually busy. Not acceptable.
"Very good price, good communication. great options locally for fitting tyres.trouble free. Highly recommend ."
"Needed tyres on holiday. Half hour to nearest town. Checked [REDACTED]. Good prices, easy to use and book at a place 5 mins down the road. Great communication. Everything was perfect and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend."
Very efficient and professional customer service.
Used [REDACTED] for the 1st time and the mobile fitting service. Was scheduled for Friday AM and I ended up getting a call around 10am advising my appointment was being cancelled so not a great experience. Managed to get rescheduled for the Monday which was ok at the office. Guys where great when they came however they didn’t put my dust caps back on after fitting the tyre so I’ve had to buy new dust caps.
"So simple to use, unbeatable prices, great choice of tyres for all budgets. Would use again and again 😁"
easy to use website sensible pricing plenty of choice on availability friendliness and reliability of fitter
"Fast, efficient service at very competitive price."
Changing your order. Made a mistake not ordering run flats for an X3 - got an email pointing this out which was very helpful - then called to change my order which was also handled well.Happy with the service I received
Efficient and excellent customer service
Very easy to order - great value
Initial booking time was cancelled but second booking progressed smoothly.
"great price and the fitting partner, AWR were excellent too"
"Easy to order, kept updated on order and Tweedale Motors gave excellent service"
Great value & service from the fitting partner in water orton.
Easy to select correct tyre and local garage to fit them on website. Anthony Luff and co were friendly and helpful. I would use them again.
"Price and ease of making the arrangements to purchase the right tyre, first time. Wiltshire Tyres were also excellent in fitting the tyres when and where I needed them. Thank you"

Great price and so easy!
"Good price. Easy ordering. Great service at the nominated garage. But... I received the text message with the time of my appointment 25 minutes, yes twenty five MINUTES, before the appointment time. Message received 7.50am. Appointment time 8.15am. That is just downright unacceptable. Get your system sorted, [REDACTED]. Luckily I know the garage and had checked with them direct so I already knew. But really???? Twenty five minutes?"
Easy to use and book and able to chooseGood Service. Easy to use and book and able to choose from local garages and tyre companys. Our local garage was excellent. Competitive prices on premium products.
Tyres were waiting ready to be fitted by 3rd party garage. Simple online purchase and a good price for them too.
"Straight forward process, low budget tyre, the garage I went to where absolutely fantastic"
"Excellent products at a great price, convenient fitting stations and overall a brilliant experience. A genuine A* purchase, very pleased"
"Delivery date changed at last minute fittng day changed making me change my plans then when tyres arrived 1 had been stored flat making it impossible for garage to fit, this caused a weeks delay untill new tyre came and was fitted. I contacted [REDACTED] about the time i had wasted and fuel used. I suggested some kind of goodwill gesture awaard for the inconvenience I had but no reply came back to me. A bit dissappointing as i was a new customer to them."
"Didn't like not being able to talk to anyone at [REDACTED] when I was ordering. My tyres are a bit specialist and expensive and here are so many codes and variations in tyres, so I wanted to make absolutely sure I was ordering the correct tyres. I couldn't find any way to do it."
I called the garage a day in advance of my arranged appointment because I was worried about my old tyre which had a split in it. They had the tyres in ready and fitted me in straight away.
Fitting of tyres went well arranging fitting a problem. Fitting of tyres went well. Getting to that stage was a problem. Arranged to have them fitted on a Thursday am confirmed then cancelled by ATS. Time for fitting them on the Friday was between 11.00 and 2.0pm but then confirmed by [REDACTED] to be 11.00am Arrived at ATS at 10.30am to be advised that the earliest the 4 tyres could be fitted was 2.0pm! Picked up vehicle at 4.15pm. Communication needs to be improved.
"Great service, quality tyres at a great price"
"No extras, fitted as request. Can't fault in any way!"
Excellent value and trouble free service
"Easy to find the tyres you want. Slightly unbelievable prices, fast delivery. Choose to have them fitted at your chosen local garage for free. Brilliant service"
Wanted to get my BMW off runflat tyres and the tyres I chose were reasonable priced. The review from another BM owner was good. The downside of this was I had to sign a disclaimer because the tyres werent ‘bmw recomended’ yet the top review was from an owner. Good tyres and well priced all the same though.
Excellent service and prices and the fitment place Stanways Lytham spot on staff and quick turn round very professional and helpfull friendly staff I have worked for 45 years as a mechanic and nice to see these places exist.
"This was a great surprise, all went so smoothly. I got a great price, all ordered and chose the garage to fit. The tyres were there and fitted in great time. Garage was very efficient and friendly too. I have heard of [REDACTED] before, but was always sceptical about this, but it all went very well, highly recommended."
Very efficient and was to order. Excellent garage.
Quick and efficient service. Cheaper prices.
Ease of booking and buying tyres
Steve at Trust tyres was superb. Efficient and friendly just went we all want
Good service and great prices
I have used [REDACTED] before and continue to be amazed at the prices. The closest partner garage to me has changed and the new one is great.
good price and straightforward local service
"I have used them several times and it is always a very easy transaction. Easy to choose the price, the garage and appointment time. Very satisfied with the garage I used. They were very quick and efficient."
Excellent on this occasion but have tried previously and could not find the right deal on those occasions.
"Good service, fair prices."
"Good customer service from McConnechies (local fitter), good prices from [REDACTED]."
Great service from [REDACTED] and PTA.Also excellent price.
Great prices . Very friendly staff . Not left for ages waiting
"Competitive price, easy to order and easy to arrange local garage"
Because of the delay at the garage
The service was really easy to use and gave additional useful information such as recommended tyre size for your car. The garages I could use were very local to me. The whole transaction went very smoothly.
Great price and so easy to use Not my first time and not my last
Great tyres and decent price
great quality tyres and saved almost £100
Due to the over all price and ease of use
"It was so easy to pick my tyres, pick a fitting location and book the appointment. The garage in Broadbridge Heath are also very efficient and I didn't have to wait long for my tyres to be fitted."
"Easy to use,good price."
Very competetive price & fantastic service at the partner fitter!
Because it’s a cheaper way to buy tyres.

Quick and efficient service. Best prices we found.
The tyre delivery was perfect
Economic and efficient way to buy and fit tyres. The price of the tyres was good and the order communications were prompt and clear. There were only a few days to wait for fitting and the fitting service went smoothly. Good service for a reasonable price.
"A very fast service . A fast easy &safe way to get the best deals on tyres,highly recommended !"
"Competitive price, convenient so no hassle. A nobrainer."
Easy to deal with
"[REDACTED]com. Easy to use site convenient, competitive prices"
Great value for money and excellent customer service at the garage.
Good price and garage did decent job. Timeslot was changed though and lucky I picked up the email. Also not sure why at the poit of purchase you don’t advise that the selected tires might not be suitable for my car and do this after the booking trying to persuade me to upgrade to something else.
"Friendly quick knowledgeable and good choice. Staff friendly and happy to chat, service quick but thorough and always on time for your appointment. Never had a bad experience. Range of tyres to choose from is great and online customer service have also been responsive when I've had a query."
"If it's not an emergency and you need to get a tyre fitted, then this is convenient, easy, generally cheaper with no hidden costs. The garages I have used have been enthusiastic and helpful."
Excellent Service would recommend. 2 new back tyres for my Motorhome. The whole process very slick. Now likely to use the garage for service and MOT. Much more enjoyable than waiting for a grumpy Kwik fit fitter
"Brilliant Service. Appointment booked with no hassle, tyres delivered in plenty of time for appointment . overall no problems at all and tyres were fitted at local garage without any trouble"
I ordered 4 tyres and one was the wrong size
[REDACTED] Tyre savvy. [REDACTED] is a cheaper way of buying tyres. I’ve used them in the past and saved a chunk of money each time. It’s easy to get a price supplied and fitted on their on their website. The only drawback I’ve experienced is that they sometimes don’t deliver the tyres in time to have the tyres fitted at the agreed time and date. Another date gets proposed or has in my experience. No problem at all to me but might be if you’ve booked time off work and can’t change it.Great system for buying your tyres cheaper though.
great prices local garage but just a little late to confirm appointment date
[REDACTED] simple to use and choices of tyres brilliant . Formula 1(2) But at the garage formula 1 tried to make me a second class citizen On booking in they said did not have the ! It turned delivered the day before . Then was told formula 1 customers would take preference over [REDACTED]
"Competitive prices and choice of local fitters. The only thing I didn't like was that it was only after I had paid for the tyres that I found that the local tyre fitter I had chosen didn't offer timed appointments, only morning or afternoon. I had to wait for over an hour on a very wet and windy day."
The fitting was excellent but it took an additional week to complete the fitting as 1 of the four tyres had gone missing.
Had an incorrect tyre initially but resolved quickly
The tyres I wanted at the right price and good fitting service
Ease of use and a very good fitting service at Nailsea
All Good. Price and fitting all good.
Very easy process - bought the tyres booked the mobile fitters and everything went as it should
"Great service ,huge range of tyre at very competitive prices."
"Excellent service, very convenient and good price."
Good selection of tyres at good prices. Plenty of choice for fitment locations
"Good prices, simple to use website for selection and ordering with appointment for fitting."
"Great prices, easy website to navigate through, good customer service. Even when the wrong tyres were ordered it was no problem getting them changed. 10/10."
"Easy, competitive and quick but I think you need more info on the fitters, maybe show their ratings on the website"
"Good prices. Customer services contacted me straight away to say the tyres I ordered may not be suitable due to the type of car I drive and sled me to respond immediately which I did. I didn’t get a response for 2 days. In the meantime I got in touch via phone and discussed what tyres would be suitable, it was found that the tyre you recommended for me would not be suitable for the vehicle and ended up fitting the tyres I originally ordered. This is my first experience of using [REDACTED] customer service and felt the situation was dealt with quite badly and I wasn’t very impressed. I would consider paying a bit more next time I purchase tyres to deal with a person face to face rather than have this situation again."
I’ve used you a few times before and it’s always simple and easy to order tyres and have them fitted at my selected garage.
"Easy process to book, no hassle in fitting - perfect"
Shocking service ordered a tyre on Thursday to be fitted on Saturday at 10am on Friday morning told won't be fitted as tyre not delivered rang up only to be told that tyre will be at garage to go for fitting at 12pm on Saturday Friday evening got a email stating my booking had been cancelled and changed for following Wednesday. Rang garage up on Saturday morning and my tyre was there so took car in for 12pm what a joke
Easy booking good pricing home fitting all went very smoothly
Easy to purchase online. Wide choice of brands. Very well priced. Booked at a convenient time. I had tyres fitted at the garage I would normally use anyway. But had a wider choice of brand through [REDACTED].Will use this method from now on
"Excellent custome service from McConnechies, good prices from [REDACTED]"
Great website and reliable friendly garage
"Eady to purchase, Wiltshire tyres mobile fitters were fantastic, quick service and friendly"
It was simple and straightforward to order the tyres and make an appointment. When you arrived for the appointment the technician was ready to go there and then. The tyres were fitted and the car was ready when I was told it would be. There were no problems and the whole experience was as I said before simple and straightforward.
Tyres poorly stored by [REDACTED] and supplied to garage squashed resulting in an extended fitting time for 4 tyres of 3 hours
"Easy to use site ,convenient competitive prices"
Easy to use. Tyres cheaper than fitter I chose and there partner fitters are very good
Always good prices
"Cheap tyres, easy to use website"
Great Price and Great Service. Best price for tyre. Easy and straightforward transaction. Fitted on time and professionally at ATS in Frome. Reminders sent throughout process. Will definitely use again. Highly recommended.
"Bought 2 X car tyres through [REDACTED], prices were competitive but the garage that Ichoosed to install tyres was not good enough. My car mat was covered in mud and caused cosmetic damage to alloy wheels. It would have been better to have an option to review on garage where tyres were installed."
"Original appointment (Saturday) not kept. Company in question not working or at least answering the phone at the weekend to arrange new appointment, email from you did not materialist. Monday morning my wife had to phone fitting company to arrange new appointment as you did nothing!"
Why buy anywhere else. Everything as ordered and on time. Fitted at expert garage and all at the best price. No queuing and top quality product and service
"Great tyres, great price. Tyres arrived at the garage promptly and the garage provided a quick, polite and professional service."
Painless experience from start to finish. Will definitely use again.
good price and efficient fitting service
Best price and extremely efficient service from a local authorised garage.
"1st time using [REDACTED], had a delay in getting my tyres, however this is probably down to being a uncommon size. fitted locally 4 new tyres fitted in 40 mins, will deffinatly be using this service again"
Amazing fast. Excellent service! Ordered motorcycle tyres at 5pm and they arrived by 1130am the next day. Cheaper than the competition too
Best price and easy to book. Will definitely use again!
Good service. Good price. Good selection Good quality. Good grief what more can you ask for ???
"Easy to book, best price and garage fitted tyres within a reasonable time frame!"
"Great prices ,ordering and delivery to match painless purchase"
The fitting garage were professional and friendly. I would recommend the service again .
"Great company, everything was very easy and straightforward. I will be using again as the prices for tyres was cheaper then my local garages"

Simple. Spot on.. And great saving!
"Great website, easy to use, great prices."
Easy to find the correct tyres and local fitter. Competitive prices. Easy booking slot with fitter.
The tyres were cheaper than buying direct from the garage.
Great service and excellent value for money
Excellent service fantastic price
Terrible customer service. My emails were answered by several separate people and I received conflicting answers from different customer service staff. Tyres were confirmed booked then had an email to say they weren’t going to be delivered on the agreed date and then another email to say they would be delivered on the agreed date. They were not delivered on the agreed date and I had to take a morning off work to have them fitted. Very poor!
"Whats not to like. Good technical information, great prices, especially for 'name' brands a choice of fitters and prompt delivery, what's not to like?"
Price of tyres was good but I was not able to get the chosen day at the garage i selected. So you need to align better with the garage calendars.
Prices can’t be beaten. Good range. User friendly website.
"Although [REDACTED] were cheaper it was certainly a mistake due to the service received. My tyres were changed but the guy complained that the tyres had arrived flat so he had had to pump them up and then fit them on his own. After fitting I realised he hadn’t checked the tyre pressures, my car is meant to have 32 psi in the front tyres and 30 psi in the back. When I looked the computer registered 40 psi in 3 of my tyres and 36 psi in another!"
VERY GOOD SELECTION OF TYRES AT COMPETITIVE PRICES WITH TRUSTED DELIVERY. TO DATE THE QUALITY OF THE FITTING AGENT HAS BEEN VERY GOOD ALSO.
"Staff were great, price was competitive and I didn’t have to wait long for the job to be done"
Very good service and mobile fitter very professional and quick.
"I chose a recommended garage to fit my tyres and the alloy wheels were absolutely ruined. When I contacted [REDACTED] I was informed it couldn’t have been done by the garage and was curb damage. It wasn’t it was between the rim and wheel like the tyres had been put on with a can opener. This is the first time they were changed, therefore could not have been done previously. I explained this by return email and have received zero response in 48hours."
"A small omission on delivery. The garage was great as always, but this time, [REDACTED] only delivered 3 out of 4 tyres, so had to rebook the appointment and wait another week for the 4th one to turn up. Otherwise all good."
Decent price and a local fitting centre who did a good job.
"eXCELLENT SERVICE, GOOD QUALITY TYRES AND QUICK DELIVERY"
The do exactly what they claim at the best price I could find for the specific tyres I wanted.
Good price local garage
My son recommended you as your prices were and quick service was very good. However; tje garage i choice to go to in order to have the tyres fitted was nit that good and i certainly will not be using them again.
Price and convenience
"Easy service. Good price, easy system, happy with fitting"
Great tyres great price with friendly mobile fitting at work
Fitter was 2 hours past the latest am time
Excellent price & fitting service.
Rearranged my appointment to help fit in with my service & M.O.T. - thank you. Polite & helpful.
New tyres best price. Excellent service tyres can be fitted at your local garage Would recommend this company Ease of use on the internet would definetly use again
Good selection of tyres and the ability to have them delivered to a garage locally and fitted there is great
Easy to use website with competitive pricing!
A very easy cost comparison of tyres.
Simple and problem free. I have recently had all new tyres on two cars from [REDACTED]. Each time has been a simple and problem free experience.
5 Star service plus value for money I would use [REDACTED] again and would recommend the company to my family and friendsTom Reilly.
"Excellent, Fram Tyres gave great service, in at 08:35, out at 09:05, 4 new tyres fitted and not a mark on my shiny alloys. Would definitely use [REDACTED] again"
"Great service at good price. Good prices, very easy to order tyres and book closest tyres centre for fittings. I am very happy with the service and I will use it again"
"Excellent service from Three Cross MOT centre. I had a few problems when my front tyres wee fitted with balancing and they’ve gone out of their way to try and put the matter right after I ordered a pair of back tyres. [REDACTED] are the cheapest and their fitters always very helpful, unlike some other national brands."
Easy process and cheapest
Good prices and quick delivery to my local garage
Because 2 tyres were ordered only 1 delivered and appointment had been confirmed twice
The garage I used was good and professional I am grateful for your introduction you were a good facilitator
Brilliant service and great value...
Good service - convenient to book time for fitting. Fair price too.
Everything went smoothly And great price
Good price with efficient and convenient service.
First class service and good pricing...
"No problems at all. Guys took the car for 1 hour and 2 new tyres , balanced and all. Great."
Excellent service great price
Tires were at a good value and it allowed to choose from a variety and send them to the garage of my choice.
Easy to use website. Great choice of tires and excellent prices. My only criticism is the garage I chose didn't give me a fitting time as was indicated on the website when I paid and booked the tires. I had to ring the garage direct to arrange a time.
Choosing from your web site is not the problem it’s the garages that we have to go to and on that particular day the mechanic was an arse towards my wife
"Initial time slot cancelled, apart from that a decent service was provided."
"Easy to browse and choose tyres and book fitting appointment, excellent service, best prices."
Excellent service. Tyres delivered on time to a local fitting station at a very competitive price. Won’t hesitate in using [REDACTED] again.
Good tyres at a good price. Very happy.
"Good price, easy to use, very efficient fitting service"
Very good service and competitive price on the tyres
"Good choice of brands, at competitive prices. Good selection of nearby fitting agents. Great service as always."
It's a great service. You have a great selection of brands at great prices. You then pick a local garage to have them fitted.
Value for money; good local fitting services
Good prices and a good service
"Excellent easy to use site and service.Found the site informative with a very wide range of suitable tyres for my vehicle. Once the choice was made, payment and arrangement of a fitment date were straightforward."
Easy to find tires of my choice and get them fitted in place of my choice. Good communication with customer.
"Good value , easy to order , quality products"
Great service from [REDACTED] to start Garage recommended absolute shambles Get the impression that once [REDACTED] have done the internet bit not interested.Then all they want is a great recommendation
"Highly recomend. Easy to use,great prices, excellent service"
Awful customer service. Took 10 days to get tyres fitted after being let down twice and only when I chased it. Blamed on business levels which is a poor excuse.
"Bloody marvellous. Great price , prompt appointment and fitted as arranged ! Can’t fault the service and to get 4 new tyres fitted to my Insignia for £264 .......... bloody marvellous!"
Arrived for 9am completed on time great service
Best prices and the partner garages are really helpful on the fitting. What’s not to like.
A good product at a good price .
"Very efficient way of buying and fitting of new tyres. Just book a date and time slot to suit you. Great way of shopping on line . Good prices, great quality on well known and budget tyres! Would def. recommend.👍"
Best price online
Easy to use website - good that you identify tyre type from car reg - fair pricing - efficient booking system for tyre fitting service
"Generally a good service, booking problems aside!There seems to be a communication problem between fitter and website which meant I had to collect the tyre from one fitter and have it fitted at another partner due to a calendar issue.Both the customer services at [REDACTED] and the fitters helped in any way they could. Just a bit frustrating.Prices were good and, apart from the glitch, everything worked as it should. For 2 different cars with tyres fitted over a 3 day period at 2 different fitters, I requested the Brake check, just for safety's sake and neither fitters I went to actually did it! That was a little irritating!"
"dont trust this garage. [REDACTED] were fine and the tyres were at the garage as expected. The garage fitted them fine, but then they told me my brakes were worn. They quoted me £170 to sort. I thought that was a bit steep and went to another garage later in the day... They told me nothing wrong with my brakes at all! Wan'st impressed with first garage and won't be using again."
"This is a pitstop not a garage. Drive in, met by tyre specialist, drive through get out. Approx 40-50min wait (go shopping get brew/have cake) go back, sign off, get in drive out. Bish bash bosh. There isnt a waiting room, or rest room, the lads have basic tools to get the job done. Would be nice if they themselves had somewhere to stay warm or at least wash their hands/somewhere to put snacks or even pee! I was happy with my service in and out. Thanks lads ! Good job done. 😃"
Tyres good price and fitting good too. Down side... I added a two wheel tracking to order but the garage charged me more for it as they said they don’t do a 2 wheels tracking and had to have a 4 wheels alignment. My point is that on a Berlingo van you can only adjust the two front wheels. So how can they charge for a 4 wheel alignment when they could only adjust 2 wheels!!!
"Very easy to use web site, good competitive prices and tyres fitted with no problems encountered on the specified day"
Very happy with [REDACTED]. Cheaper than anywhere else and good availability. Work carried out with no problems
"Look elsewhere unless you want your alloys damaged. I used this company and their Agent, Mercia Motors, and they chipped recently fully professionally refurbished alloys on our car. Following previous bad experience with that garage we took photos of all 4 alloys. We even told them that they were unmarked when the car went in. We did not sign the job sheet to say we were satisfied. We complained to [REDACTED] about their agent and they then took several weeks before denying responsibility. Neither they or their agent could give a toss despite the evidence. Use someone you can trust and that's neither of these muppets !"
"Awesome price. Had to wait a while for the tyres to come in stock, but excellent service and updated at all times."
Great service phoned them managed to get me in a day earlier.
Valve cap missing on front offside tyre
"A very efficient, high value and flexible system that I have used now on four occasions and will continue to do so."
"Again, an excellent outcome, with helpful staff."
Good price. Only £6 extra to have 4 tyres fitted at home. The fitter was great. No hanging around in a garage. I'll definable use [REDACTED] again!
Very good price. Well fitted once the job got started. I had to wait 90 minutes after my appointed time as the company was running late. Their coffee machine was switched off and nobody knew the wifi password.
"I accidentally ordered non run flats for my car. I went back to [REDACTED] and they very easily and pain free ordered me the correct set and sent them down to the garage. Great customer service, highly recommended"
Overall very good just a small glitch with late delivery.
Very easy. Good tyres at good prices
Very efficient service from order to fitting
Arrived 5 minutes before the appointed time. Paperwork was ready. Car was taken into the fitting bay within 5 minutes and returned to me with the new tyres fitted 35 minutes later. Excellent service. Highly recommended.
Motorvation Northampton. Easy to buy. Excellent garage nearby with exceptional customer service. Completed work on the day. Also requested replacement break pads. The price for this extra work was very competitive. Overall very pleased will recommend others and I am using garage again for forthcoming MOT.
"Faultless. Very competitive prices, excellent website and skilled fitters. Wasn't able to make it to the appointment initially scheduled (flat battery) but customer service were very helpful and understanding and rearranged the appointment. Have used BC 3 times and been more than satisfied each time."
good price delivery poor this time. [REDACTED] are keen on their pricing but this last order was not delivered to the garage on time caused a problem with MOT
"The best prices and good choice of fitter. Let down a bit by the admin who emailed me saying my chosen fitting date wasn't available, but when I contacted fitter they had the tyres in and were ready for fitting."
Great. Really easy to find what I needed and get booked in for when I wanted.
"Competitive prices online , easy to order , immediate confirmation and update , seem less process through to fitting ; Local garage, Lavender Motors , Hayward’s Heath provided good service . No problems and very happy with tyres - Michelin cross climate plus."
"Absolutely simple to order new tyres, the price was right and the garage was very timeous, superb and painless experience from start to finish"
I like how simple it was to do and I liked being able to have the choice of what I wanted from so many options
Easy and very straightforward way to save money and arrange a fitting
"Left me stranded Dont care about customers. [REDACTED] cancelled my fitting at the 11th hour and left me stranded for an urgent trip I needed to go on the following day. They think postponing a fitting by nearly a week at the last minute is ok. Their early fitting date was the only reason I used them. When I emailed them asking for help getting the tyres fitted sooner they just ignored me. They seem to do business on their therms only. So prepare to be rightly screwed over, coz one thing is sure... they don't give a F*^K about their customers. Thanks putting me in this mess guys! Really great doing business with you."
I have used [REDACTED] before and been very happy. The tyres were ordered & delivered for fitting at a local partner garage with no issues and a good price. I have given four stars due to the service by the garage who made a real mess of the tracking after their free check. This needed a return visit for a four wheel alignment which still didn’t provide the service i paid for.
Good price good service...great idea
very competitive price....very convenient
Good website. Easy to work out size of tyres eTC and good value without having to shop around.
New Tyres. Easy to order and choice of fitters. Good prices too
Excellence from start to finish. Very simple and straightforward to used the websiteThe selected garage was courteous and efficient On the very rare (once) occasion that there was a mix up over time slot I was called and a very patient and helpful [REDACTED] employee made the time to sort the issue.Definitely 5 starts
Great choice of tyres to suit wide range of vehicles and individual needs and affordability. Speedy initial response but slow re-action to reselection request which was eventually time denied due to delay. Not 10. Lucky to be 9. Direct Tyres fitting service in Stockport was brilliant with a very speedy turnaround. Am old customer and will use again!
I have bought tyres before from [REDACTED] and been pleased with the whole experience. Again I have been impressed with the service and the excellent friendly and fairly local fitting service in Adfa Mid Wales.
"Easy process, good choice of tyres at competitive prices."
"An easy way to buy tyres, convenient and competitively well priced with lots to choose from"
Good prices and service
If I could leave a 0 or minus I would absolutely shocking paid for tyres 3 weeks ago got first fitting date then got cancelled got second fitting date and tyres weren’t even there [REDACTED] = black mark in my book
"Had 4 tyres fitted by Ruislip tyres, Breakspear on Tues 13Aug2019. Excellent job, they even sorted my drivers mirror that Kept popping out.... no charge."
"My experience with [REDACTED]com is the best I have had in years. My experience with [REDACTED].com is just second to none. Good value for money in cost, convenience and all this made possible by just a few clicks. Found the brand I wanted cheaper than most, chose to have the tyres fitted at a place I trust in my town, Stevenage. Won't be using anyone else any time soon."
Very knowledgable friendly staff. Easy process from online order to fitment. Good price great service overall.
Service was good: Wide choice of tyres with good reviews; simple to use website; Garage was quick & efficient with fitting of tyres
"Cost effective, efficient service."
"Excellent transaction. Found a deal that suited best, ordered 4 tyres to be fitted at a specific time, received confirmation of booking and further confirmation of fitting time as expected. Tyre fitting experience was good so all in all, Happy 😊 Many Thanks"
Easy to order and to book a very local fitter - all done without any issue at all.
Used many times before. Easy to use. Easy to arrange fitting. Good prices
Best prices and always very dependable on delivery!
Good prices and service.
Because they are great .with great prices and u can choose one of there fitters . That do a really good and friendly and vary helpful
Great value and great service.
"Easy to use website, tyres delivered on time."
Top service. Good discount.
"Good prices, good choice of local suppliers and excellent &'quick service when tyres fitted."
"Would highly recommend [REDACTED]com tyres. Would highly recommend their on-line services, very easy to navigate the website and great information to help select the best quality tyres."
"The process was really straightforward and simple. However when I went into the garage they either hadn’t read that I’d also selected an MOT as well as tyre change, or didn’t receive confirmation. So this now needs done another day"
"I had to wait 2 day for the person to deliver and fit my tyres, no one called me to explain the person will be late so i waited for a whole day, only for me to call up your office and be told it wasn't going to be fitted today, i wasn't told why/. i was told the fitted will be at mine by 9:am tomorrow however they didn't turn up until 13:30."
Easy process and good prices
"Great service, great prices"
Nominated garage nearby so very handy. Fitters all good
Best price for the tyres
Really impressed with the customer serviceI accidentally ordered the wrong tyres and they helped me out with correcting my order they where very polite and knowledgeable and I would definitely recommend them
Generally good. Price possibly could be more competitive!
had small issues with time slots and delivery of tyres to selected garage but got there in the end
"Very easy order, fitting booked in and completed, no problems at all."
Very efficient and simple procedure and a good price.
"Fast and efficient service again from [REDACTED] and our local ATS centre. Tyres were delivered to site next day and ATS fitted and swapped the tyres round free of charge. I was offered other services whilst there but not in a pushy sales way, just really nice chaps doing their job in a friendly way. Many Thanks."
The tyres were delivered on time and fitted by the garage but they were unable to perform the 4 wheel alignment as my car wasnt on their 'system'
Excellent service took on time and a quick turn around with good quality work
"Great products, good prices, easy to use website and excellent communication"
This is the first time I have used this service and it was straightforward. It is cheaper for branded tyres. I will be using the service again.
Quick professional service and importantly no damage to my alloys
Tyres. You got what was on the packet but not the cheapest for the tires
Excellent service by [REDACTED] as well as the fitting service at Longmynd garage. Fitting conducted very quickly and staff were very friendly.
"[REDACTED] forgot to deliver the tyre to the fitter, so wasted my morning. Then had to rebook again for another morning once they found the tyre. Next time I shall go to somewhere that can deliver when they say they will. At least customer services were polite and apologetic."
Good choice of tyres and fair prices. Easily arranged fitting with a very efficient fitting company and many alternative fitters available. Only disadvantage may be if you want very fast fitting.
Great service saved £££ on Tyres at choice of fitting centers all close to place of work. Easy booking system.
So easy to use and great value for money.Garage used was local and they were very efficient.
price and quick turn round of service but selected garage lets you down
"Cheap good quality tyres, fantastic quick and convenient option to get mobile fitting for only £5-6"
Delivered on time at a reasonable price
"Very efficient service, local fitters."
Very good service palite and friendly thanks
Excellent service and value for money. Wouldn't buy tyres through any one else now. Have recommended [REDACTED] to a number of people already.
"I've been a customer for quite a few years and I would only buy from someone else if their prices were well below yours, which they're not! I recommend you to anyone who asks."
Excellent value for money for quality tyres.
"Returning and satisfied customer. I've used [REDACTED] a few times and I've never had any problems worth noting. The price is competitive, the service I have received has been good and there's always a great choice of tyres."
"Competative on price, quick delivery available and can get them delivered to a local garage."
"Dont bother. Order 1: went to the garage, who informed me the wrong tyres had been ordered. An hour wasted and 30 mines on the phone later...Order 2: booking made for Sat 24th. Email later arrived to say garage had no appointments and could I reschedule for Sun 25th at 12.00. Agreed to do so due to 10% voucher. Turned up at 12.00 to find ""we don't do appointments, waiting time is around 2 hours. If you leave and come back, you will lose your place"". Do yourself a favour and go to your local garage. Maybe more expensive, but at least you won't have to deal with [REDACTED]."
Great service and price to match
Why go anywhere else. Great site easy to use. Very competitive prices loads to chose from. Customer service is spot on. I wouldn’t go anywhere else.
"I had a problem with the time of fitting first. I arranged it for 10 am but when I arrived they said that it was 11 am, so we went for a coffee but when we returned they informed us that the tyres had not arrived, so we had a wasted journey. I did sort it out when I got home with a phone call."
"Excellent price, good availability of tyres that I wanted, and on-time delivery. On this particular order on only two tyres I saved £90 compared to 6 months ago when I had an emergency and had to buy two tyres from the nearest fitter because I had a massive blowout. £90! And that paid for a complete re-tracking of my entire vehicle, which was effectively free."
"Competitive prices, good selection of local garages, had an issue with one of the garages (changing time) but staff at [REDACTED] sorted this and arranged another garage."
"Very Happy. Recently ordered a set of 4 Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 5s for my Mercedes E-Class Cabriolet.Great tyres, great price (with an additional £25 discount on top for buying four) and delivered direct to my local garage for fast and convenient fitting.Will definitely use [REDACTED] again!"
"just bough 4 new tyres off them saved me £250 and the guy who fitted them was great no quibbles whatsoever , will defo use again thanks"
Great tyres and excellent service!
Just easy and reasonably priced
Always a Great Experience. We have used [REDACTED] several times now and they continue to provide an excellent service at a great price.
Great service from order to fitting.
God and quick servive
Good response to my order and corrected my error when I made a mistake
Prices not as competitive as they once were
Always competitive prices and great choice of tyres
Excellent service competively priced very prompt.
"Excellent value, local fitting,"
Excellent tyres. Good tyres I will recommend their products to anyone that wants to buy.
Very easy to use and the prices were good. I haved used [REDACTED] several times and always been pleased.
"Easy to book, lots of choice, excellent service"
Tyres got delivered to garage of my choice swiftly & efficiently
I had a booking at 10.30am. I turned the fitters said it would take 1.5Hrs to fit the tyres on my car as it was a Tesla. I have had tyres fitted before only took around 30min. they were extremely busy. based on this I got a taxi to my brother's because what was I going to do for an hour and a half. I got a call at 11.47 from the tyre fitters asking me for my pin so that could start the electric engine in my car to move it. It had not been moved from where I parked it At 12.30 I decided to go back down to the tyre fitters they were still in the process of fitting my tyres. My car was blocked by another car that had no wheels on it. I the had to wait for these wheels to be fitted. I finally got away about 1.30pm. I had asked for the best of the 2 tyres to be put into my boot. so that I could keep it for emergency puncture replacement. I got home it was not there. I had to go back again and waste another 10-20 minutes while they looked for my tyre. It screwed up my day as I needed to do things/ shopping before we departed by car to France on Sunday morning.
"Because I’ve always found [REDACTED] easy to deal with and cheap on price. The one bad point, sorry but no one is that perfect, is some garages are not fit to be [REDACTED] representatives!"
"Simply can not fault, it was cheap they made it easy and I got what I wanted for less than everywhere else I checked. Nice one."
Issues with the partner garage
Does exactly as it claims to doat the cheapest price I could find for the specific tyres I wanted.No complaints what so ever.
All good will use again
Great and easy to use know the system as use it where i work.
"Good all round service, good selection of tyres, very helpful.Had tyres fitted at home - fitter arrived very promply, was very friendly and professional.Will definately use again"
"Quick and easy to pick tyre, location and time."
"Great choice, easy to compare brands and prices and a local tyre fitter"
Excellent service. Tyres purchased were significantly cheaper than could be bought locally but were fitted at my usual tyre fitting company as arranged with the same level of customer service I am used to from them.I will definitely be using [REDACTED] again and have already recommended them to others. 10/10.
"Excellent service, easy to use website with good info on tyres and well priced. Sent to garage as arranged and fittings at time stated and on day of mot & service.Would recommend to anyone who is looking for tyres,"
"Easy to book, tyres delivered to fitter - no issues - have used before for same reasons"
"Price,easy of purchase,hassle free"
"Good price friendly fitting. Good prices and fitted by small local friendly garage, much better experience than some of the big fitting stations."
"Does exactly what it says on the tin ...Great prices, great service and great tyres.Thank you!"
"I booked a date/time to fit my tyres.I was later contacted to say that the time I had chosen could not be accommodated. I had to change some prior commitments to accommodate the new time slot.When I got there I had to wait for over 20 mins for the fitter to start on my car.Having said that, he did a very good job."
Very good customer service despite we requesting refund due to picking incorrect tyres
great price and service
"Brillant way to get tyres, quick and easy and a lot more competitive on price"
"Easy to use and good service by local garage, Campbells of Deal"
"Ease of use, great range and prices. What more can I say! Really pleased with the service and can highly recommend,"
"Good price and the fitting centre (ATS Tewkesbury) had everything ready at the fitting time, including all paperwork."
The website is clear and easy to use and the service that I received from the garage was brilliant.
Easy service just could have been available sooner
"Good price, quick fitting, perfect transaction."
Wide range of choice at a good price
Good website- good choice of product to suit all budgets
It turned out that the tyres were cheaper at ATS. Called [REDACTED] and they wouldn't price match. If the price was within a few £ I wouldn't be bothered but £30 is a little different.
tyres and price great fitting centre useless
"Excellent communication, the fitters were helpful and flexible and the price was very competitive"
Surely there cant be an easier process than dealing with [REDACTED] ? Best price I could find and tyres were delivered and fitted within 2 days.
Very helpful to fine a good tyre and cheaper.
"Thought it was too good a deal but . Thought it was “too good a deal” and checked out the local tyre fitting garage option before I went ahead. They assured me that they couldn’t get near the prices in Michelin tyres and regularity had [REDACTED] customers so went ahead.Tyres and fitting ordered with 4 days lead time and all done and dusted as booked!As long as you check what tyres you need, they do a huge range and choice, an excellent service."
Great price and a great service from the Garage
All perfect. Work well done. In time. No problems at all. Very good job by the two men working on my car at Cambridge Bar Hill.
Got a fast response from the lads and a good all round job
"Booked an appointment online for new tires and received an email indicated that they couldn't accommodate my preferred slot and suggested an alternative timing. I dutifully followed the instructions to 'reply to this email' if the timing was acceptable. I received no further reply. A few days later I sent a follow-up email to confirm if my new timing was set. I did not receive a reply. I figured I would show up to the garage for my new appointment anyways and hope they could squeeze me in. The garage was very accommodating and fulfilled my order despite having rejected the work request. No fault of the garage here, [REDACTED] customer support dropped the ball. All well and good to take my money before the service but don't bother to communicate when you can't actually do it. 0 out of 10 for [REDACTED].com - 10/10 for the garage that cleaned up after your terrible customer service."
"1. Incorrectly delivered an 18 inch & 19 inch tyre instead of 2 18 inch tyres. 2. Once this had been corrected went to get tyres fitted and was appalled by the shabby condition of the tyres, they looked unused but old. Indeed they were very old with a dot date of 4517 (ie nearly 2 years old)."
"Highly recommend. Bought my tyres online and booked a fitting slot at a garage near my home, turned up 1/2 hour before my fitting time and the guys went to work straight away. I ask for a price to have my rear tyres replaced but they couldn’t Mach the price of [REDACTED]. I would highly recommend this site, and I will definitely use them again."
"Booked time slot of 0930 was actually AM. Booked time slot actually not available... Dispite confirmations on time from [REDACTED] the garage selected does not actually do specific time appointments but only AM/PM slots. No fault of the garage themselves and they did their best to appease me and get it through asap. Better care needed next time in checking a specific time window is CONFIRMED and not ""just"" AM or PM has been agreed between [REDACTED] and the garage."
"very competitive prices, convenient location and at a time of my choosing. I was able to nip in on my way back from work without having to fo out of my way and it was all done in half an hour."
"The web site is easy and efficient without any issues or complications. No problems with Tyre delivery or fitting and the garage approved was friendly, quick and hassle free. Communication was spot on."
"I found this to be a very efficient service, quick and reliable all organised from home my tyres were replaced at Culloden Garage who as always completed with an excellent service."
"Great value and service. [REDACTED] offered the widest choice at the best price. My tyres were delivered quickly and fitted and balanced by the local approved garage, Motorworx Garage, Glasgow G13, without any problems. Excellent from start to finish."
"The online experience was very straightforward, the prices were competitive, and the delivery/fitting was efficiently carried out."
Great customer service and tyres were fitted before fitting date great service XX
"Brilliant Pricing, Large Choice, Hassle-Free experience"
"First class. Very easy to use the website, reasonable prices & fast service."
"Easy navigation on the website, reasonable prices"
An easy and reliable and cost sensitive way to purchase the tyre. I would say it was a no headache model.
Very user friendly site. Tyre prices with discount code excellent!Easy booking and fitting service at a garage and time that suits.Have used [REDACTED] for 8 years 10/10
Great first experience. First time of using [REDACTED]. Took a couple of circuits of the website to filter down to what I needed. The process from order through to fitting was seamless and I would recommend - saved about £15/tyre.
Prices were 30% cheaper than dealer quote and I had the freedom of choosing my local garage.Fitting was super quick and easy! Would recommend!
"Quick, easy and reasonably priced"
Excellent service and priceexcellent service. Excellent service and price.I hadn't realised that the tyres could have been stored for some time.
The tyres were delivered on time and the job completed efficently
Car had been cleaned before tyre replacement..when I picked car up it was dirty and fuel had been used. Looks like it had been used to pick parts up for another job. Im very unlikely to use [REDACTED] again.
Best prices
good price good service
Great prices and service - you can't ask for more!
"Price, ease of purchase and booking."
"easy to use website, good garage"
Happy customer. Well priced.easy to use web site.Tyres fitted on arival of appointment.Very pleased with service.
Good Company Decent prices. Good co. To buy from. Decent prices but be selective of the tyre fitting centre you choose
Booking time late morning and no question of what time would like.
Easy to choose the my tyres and select a convenient fitting time and date. Also when I selected the wrong tyres (with out knowing) I contacted [REDACTED] who changed them to the correct ones and got them sent over to the garage for fitting.
Easy ordering and good value for money with convenient fitting options
Good service and selection of tyres at the right price.
had some issues with fitting but customer services dealt with it very proficiently
better value for money from the same garage
It was effortless to order and have the chosen tires fitted at a reasonable price.
"Easy to purchase Delivered on time, excellent service during fitting"
"Everything went smoothly, the tyre was correct; the contracted fitter was excellent."
was rude garage raccomanded
A good service at a fair price. I will definitely use [REDACTED] again.
Excellent service. Ordered 2 tyres from [REDACTED]. Best price I could find on the net for the tyres I wanted. Had the choice of a few local garages who would fit them. Tyres were delivered to garage and I waited around 30 minutes for them to be fitted. Cant fault any aspect of the service and I will definitely be using [REDACTED] and the garage again.
Everything was perfect from start to finish. Especially the mobile fitting.
"Good value, easy to use and great service from their partner company doing the tyre change."
"Great easy service, booked in for all your tires by a mobile tire fitter, let me know the evening before what time to expect them then came at that time, nice and easy!"
The easiest and simplest way to buy good tyres . Efficient processing of order and local fitters were very prompt and professional.I give [REDACTED] 5 STARS
Excellent. We were very impressed with this service. The garage were very helpful
"Straight forward and hassle free. Very easy and simple to use web site,tyres delivered very prompt and the cheapest prices too,."
"The original date for tyres to be fitted was changed to a later time, which was fine as I was notified a few days before the appointment. When I attended the rescheduled time for the tyres to be fitted, the tyres had not arrived at the fitting centre. I was not contacted by [REDACTED] telling me the tyres had not arrived and the appointment had been rescheduled again. The tyre centre had to inform me when I arrived of the cancellation. After contacting [REDACTED] from the tyre center no answer could be given as to why I hadn't been informed. The tyres never arrived for the third date that I had been given over the phone. In the end I asked the tyre centre to inform me when the tyres arrived which was a week after the original date. It was a good job I didn't have a service and MOT arranged during the middle of that week, which I required the tyre for."
Web-site was easy to navigate and order the tyres with a good choice of local fitting centres. I purchased two top range tyres for a good price and my chosen fitting centre fitted them at the time and date I chose without any additional fees. Will use again.
[REDACTED] Ticks All Boxes. Great selection of quality tyres at competitive prices and good selection of approved local fitters.
Delivered within time to desired garage very smooth and simple
"[REDACTED] first choice for tyres. Searched many websites for car tyres found [REDACTED] to be the best for ease of use,value for money and fitting centre"
Quick delivery and easy fitting. Tyres were made available to the nearest fitting centres within few days and the fitting was done in under 30 mins. without any issue.
"The best all round service for replacement tyres. Best price, swift availability, proficient fitters. Very good all round."
Easy online service and no problems with the fitting. Way cheaper than a dealer.
Excellent service and price.
Customer service was second to none. Even checked to advise that the tyres I’d ordered were not specific N rating and that it could cause warranty issues.
"Had the correct tyres in stock for the vehicle, fast response, good price and fitter was helpful, early and was happy to deal with a third party to get access to the vehicle as it was in a secured car park. Totally painless experience!"
Excellent customer service and quality tyres
Wide range and good prices. Network of reliable fitters.
Easy order tyres turn up at time to suit you have them fitted.
"Very informative, efficient site. Was able to thoroughly look at a wide range or tyre options and make an informed choice. Ordering, payment and arrangement of fitting was straightforward."
Best price and service. Really happy with the purchase.
Good serviceGood quality tyres Will use again
really good good price and service
"Good prices, but the garages fitting the tyres don't give a toss. Didn't balance my rear wheels, just slapped some weights on. Drove the car the following day (Sunday) and it vibrated so badly, I though the car was going to shake apart. The garage that fitted the tyres were closed, so had to pay for balancing at kwik fit. They told me that one of the wheels needed 60 grams added and the other 35, and that neither rear had been balanced, just weights slapped in to look like it had been done. ."
Excellent website. Excellent choice. Fitter very near by. Very smooth process from start to finish
Online was not good but direct call excellent
"Even though it didn’t go perfectly, the [REDACTED] team really came through. I booked an at home fitting prior to travelling across the country. When the fitter failed to turn up, [REDACTED] (Amy) immediately dealt with it by offering alternatives. When I told them I was going to be somewhere else they rang around that area and persuaded a busy fitter to make an extra appointment for me. They really went the extra mile to deliver the best service they could in the circumstances."
4 tyres not the same make and fitted on different days
"Excellent. Good price, excellent choice of tyres, quick response and the fitter was early and couldn't have been more helpful"
"Even though i had a strict appointment time and asked to be there 5 minutes before, i was still waiting 35 minutes before fitting!"
long wait for one tyre 1 hour 10 mins but I was told the they were running late
Quick and efficient service well priced
A quick and easy online based order facility which saved money whilst offering a good choice of replacement tyres.
Quick efficient service from [REDACTED] and the garage the tyres were sent to be fitted !
"Not as good as previous experience. Had fantastic service in the past, but this time was not so good.I ordered 2 x Michelin Pilot SuperSport tyres in 255/35/19 profile to be fitted several days later at 9am at a local ATS branch.Dropped the car with them on the basis that it would be ready by lunchtime, so I arranged to collect the car then (as I needed to use it in the afternoon).At 11am I received a call from ATS to say they’d removed my old tyres and realised that the new ones hadn’t arrived from [REDACTED].com. They offered to order them in but I’d not be able to collect the car until the end of the day as the tyres wouldn’t arrive until 4pm.This was nothing worse than an inconvenience, but given that the price paid was identical to ATS fitted price (but they had a deal on when you bought two tyres) and in actual fact £20 more expensive that Kwik Fit, I regretted automatically going to [REDACTED] based on previous experience."
"Its so easy to search using your vehicle registration. Then you can choose a tyre based on price, performance, road noise and fuel economy. To choose fitted as well just makes a laborious process so simple."
Top tyers for bottom prices. The whole experience was flawless from the service from [REDACTED] to the fitting of my new tyers. This isn't a one off I've used [REDACTED] for a number of years now and never had a problem. Thank you Black cercle.
Great service. Fast delivery to a garage close at hand. I’ve used [REDACTED] a number of times now and have always had great service from them.
"Easy and efficient service. Easy web site, good prices, wide selection and efficient service at local garage."
"I would use them again. Simple, economical, efficient, cheerful'Worked like a charm, including the tyre fitting company."
Excellent first time online experience. Excellent straight forward and best prices by [REDACTED] tyres. By ordering online to having the tyres fitted by choosen garage a very smooth transaction.
"good work. great guys , neat quick job"
"We booked to have our tyre fitted as we were going on holiday, unfortunately we got a email the evening before stating our tyres had not been delivered and we would have to wait 4 days,we rang them the next day they were so unhelpful saying they didn’t have time to ring round dealers to check if they had our tyres, Avoid"
Excellent Service. I arrived at the appointed time and my vehicle was checked by the fitter and taken to the bay. the whole process lasted approximately 30 mins. i could not fault the company for their excellent service.
Excellent deal done with minimum fuss. Original tyres agreed we’re unavailable and more expensive alternatives provided at no extra cost.
Worth paying £12 for mobile service
"Good website,quick ordering and agreed local fitting and agreat price"
Waited for hours. People drove in without booking and were seen before me. Is this because you already had my .money?
Simple job done. Four good value tyres fitted by my usual garage. No problems.
My choice of tyres available at a good price.Excellent service from ATS
Easy to choose and best prices. Easy to use website ensures you select the right spec tyres for your car. Great choice of brands and really good prices.
Easy to use web site. Price good
Fair market price good choice of fitters available locally which also support the B:C brand
"I ordered my tyre and had it fitted within 3 days, brilliant service"
I was told 11am fitting time by [REDACTED]. Garage had me down for 1pm.
Almost walked out of the garage when guy on reception said there were no [REDACTED] bookings that day and no tires had arrived. Only when I asked him to check the computer diary and the deliveries for the day did he find the booking then the tiers. Then I was at the back of the que to have them fitted it took over 2 hours (even fitted tiers for people that arrived after me!). Anyhow awful service not using [REDACTED] or ATS again.
I phoned ahead to be told he was too busy (Thursday) and could I come in later. I agreed but then later couldn’t manage. Went along next day - no good. Went Monday and they were fitted while I waited.
"Easy website to use, great service, loads of choice, a new and innovate way to purchase tires"
Polite friendly reception staff. Helpful and accommodating.. quick and professional service
Excellent Website and Service. Excellent Website. Competitive prices. Excellent fitting service.
"Competitively priced, easy to arrange and very convenient as you can book in to your chosen garage at a time to suit you."
Hassle free. Easy to use web site booked local fitting centre all done in a couple of days hassle free.
"Excellent service, easy to use and the best price"
Very easy to use this service. Tyres seem to be good value.
Quick and simple. Quick and straight forward booking and service.
"made a good job of changing the tyres, unfortunately didn't clean them after they were changed and the tyres and wheels had lots of lubricant over them."
"Get a Grip and get your tyres from [REDACTED]com. Easy to use website , great prices and efficient fitting on home drive."
Garage not the best
"Garage Was Great [REDACTED] Wasnt. Overall, I'm really chuffed with the product (4 x Michelin Pilot Sport 4's) and the job the premier partner (Strathclyde Autotune) carried out.However, the customer service experience at [REDACTED] left a lot to be desired after it came to light I was consistently given incorrect information by email, and later on the phone.To cut a long story short, [REDACTED] appear to book jobs and services for you on their own system without consulting the garage you choose and their schedule for that given day.I booked a tyre fitting for 4 new tyres and selected some additional services.I was never given an appointment time. Similarly, the services I selected were split across a Friday and a Monday.Not the end of the world..but the tyre fitting was scheduled for Friday and TPMS Sensor Valve Replacement was scheduled for the Monday.For me it made more sense to fit the sensors on Friday whilst the wheels are already coming off to fit the tyres?Anyway, I phoned to challenge this aspect and to double check why I wasn't given an appointment time.I was told adamantly that the garage operated on a first-come-first-serve basis and that they couldn't provide the additional services I asked for.I struggled to see the value in this system over scheduled appointments; but I went along with it as I had already paid for the tyres.Cut To: Me the next day getting up super early to be the first person in this first-come-first-serve queue.After arriving at the garage before the staff, I thought it was odd that no other people were rushing to get there first?Turns out that the garage has an appointment book, and [REDACTED] tell you it's first-come-first-serve, and split your services across a weekend for no other reason than to cause total inconvenience?The garage was great though!.. I've had the car back there since and will continue to use them."
"I had booked a day off for them to be fitted, only to be told it wouldn’t be delivered in time, so was given another date, wired for that date to be told I had to wait 3 days after that too! So all in all I lost 3 work days."
Overall I achieved what I needed - replacement tyres but it took longer than expected as the garage I booked it with advised the day before fitting that it would have to wait another week.
Fast effective service & came with discount. Paid through PayPal credit so I managed to get 0% finance on my tyres to pay off by November. Bonus!
Overall excellent but on this occasion not the lowest price.
"RSJ Tyres. Prompt, efficient, honest service"
"Excellent Tyres. Tyres excellent, and the usual brand that Hyundai would use. Great value for money - choice of fitter however not so good. If you have pressure sensor valves - which are very common now - make sure you speak with the fitter of choice beforehand and that they are familiar with them."
"Easy to arrange, had the home fitting service and Chris was excellent. Was worth the extra premium for that service."
U had the tyres I wanted at the best price and a place and time convenient to me
website easy and local fitting options
"Great web resource to qualify choice, fast and trouble free delivery, trusted end point fitting."
"Excellent service from [REDACTED] and McConnachys, St Andrews"
Arrived 10 Minutes before my allocated time only to be told there were 3 other customers in front of me. After 3 hours I still had not had a call to confirm if my tyres had been fitted. Called head office who were also unable to get in touch with the fitting station. When I went back to the fitting station my tyres had just been fitted but nobody bothered to call me. On returning home I noticed that the tyres fitted were not the tyres I ordered!
"I chose a garage from the site, at a time that suited me. I was then informed the garage had no slots that day. Another garage was booked for 1pm on the same day. When I got to that garage I was told that it was 12pm not 1pm. Despite a conformation email the garage said they were told 12pm and could not do anything. 4 days later I managed to have them fitted."
"Good organisation, and communication - had to change fitting garage but went smoothly. Will use again"
"Convenience, price and variety."
"Tyres very good, experience with the tyre fitters not so good."
"reliable advice if required, good value and the system works"
Brilliant service. Great value for money.
"Great prices and selection of tyres with local fitting, what is not to like."
Good price! Quick fitting service.
Good prices and an easy to use website.
Good price although when I attended ats it would appear they had a cheaper deal on!
Great price fast delivery to my local trusted tyre fitter
"Excellent Price, able to choose fitting agent and time to suit, excellent service from a garage I trust."
When I dropped my car off and they got my tyres off they found my new tyres hadn’t been delivered yet and nobody had let me know. They were told they had emailed myself but I never received anything.
"Good price for a difficult tyre to find, good choice of fitters. Luckily my 'local' garage (8 miles away), the only one I can fit my motorhome in that is not in the London Low Emission Zone, was on the list. Great job by Sandown Autopoint."
"I have now bought tyres on several occasions from [REDACTED] and the service is always reliable, the tyre choice is vast and the price is very difficult if not impossible to better."
I have only had the tyres a week - so far very satisfied.
"It was a good job I was present when tyre was being changed, as the wrong tyre was being removed, before I intervened? Make your own mind up ? On that one"
Courier didn’t deliver tyres to garage on time so booked slot cancelled. Despite telling [REDACTED] multiple times that the replacement slot was unacceptable (car was not available) it was booked. I have used multiple times and this is first issue but they need to get customer advisers who can read/understand.
Smooth transaction no worries tyres arrived and fitted on time excellent
Good tyres. Got good tyres and work well on my mini cooper
No hassle good service at tyre providers at a good price
Used Easy Mobile tyre fitting service (Premier Mobile) who arrived within the time slot on the order and fitted three tyres speedily without fuss. This avoided the hassle of travelling and waiting for fitment at a garage. Ordering was simple and was followed by good communication from [REDACTED]. Price was extremely competitive. Would not hesitate to use again.
"The range of tyres and the price was better than most. However, [REDACTED] did not have Continental tyres that matched my car specification and I felt that if I had bought tyres direct from HiQ (where they were fitted) the service would have been better."
"Hassle free way to replace tyres,good service value for money happy motoring."
"Easy and cheap, can't complain"
"No option on the menu to input Company details to receive VAT invoice . Contacted [REDACTED] prior to purchase and was told “ no problem, just email sales and they will provide one”. Initially after sending email we were told this was not possible After several emails over 2 days we actually got one! Not sure if I would use again because of all the hassleOn the plus side , Jon the fitter from ‘The Tyre Fitters’ was superb! Turned up on time and was polite and professional"
"MOTORCYCLISTS: I ordered my tyre with BC having read the bit about ordering a tyre from them and having it fit by a local dealer. It was more than I would have paid for the tyre elsewhere, but I figured with the cost of fitting it worked out reasonable. What they failed to make clear, is that they don't provide this service for motorbikes. I contacted their customer services and explained myself, only to be met with a kind of ""who cares"" response.The moral is, get your tyres elsewhere. Its cheaper."
"The company that only puts itself first never the customer. Was given unacceptably last minute notice my tyres were not going to be delivered and ready for fitting, -despite the fact I had taken time off work for this appointment in advance (and could not reclaim that day of holiday with such short notice). [REDACTED] have remained totally unappreciative of that lost holiday and great inconvenience. Indeed they have made no acknowledgment of this complaint whatsoever -that is how much they respect customers and value a customer's time. [REDACTED] have a diabolical level of customer care that not only completely ignores any complaint you might make or loss suffered, but also will take atleast 24 hours to offer you any response at all (making rescheduling even more inconvenient). I had to schedule the appointment myself directly with the fitter as [REDACTED] proved utterly redundant as any support or help in this way. It was then my horror to experience their recommended fitter (Johnsons Motors) jack up my car incorrectly (despite my clear and polite request the fitter confirm with me where to jack my car before raising it). I had to shout at the unresponsive engineer to lower my car immediately upon noticing (only by chance) their incompetence. The fitter then proved argumentative, dishonest before shouting their refusal to do any further work at all -despite the fact the work was already paid for via [REDACTED]. I have made yet another complaint to [REDACTED] for this further diabolical low level of quality product and customer service offered via their company -who have again sought to ignore this complaint as well. They have also so far ignored my fair and rightful request of a full refund. Without any service, any real communication and no product honoured, -I am now considering legal action to recover my funds and potential losses from damages. Please spare yourself a long path of misery and get your tyres elsewhere. There are plenty other deals on offer if you look a little longer past the many deals [REDACTED] seek to flood upon the online arena. All the best"
"Used [REDACTED].com twice now. Great service, good choices and very good prices. Keep rolling on!!!!"
Local garage almost half price. Found a price almost half of what I was quoted elsewhere. Happy that I could use a local garage and will continue to use them in future.
Excellent process well priced tyres ! Never seem to win anything though no matter how many sets I buy !
"The staff were very friendly when I arrived , and my tyres were fitted very quickly . I will definitely be using this garage again ."
Great service good value
"Effortless and best value around. Wish they gave you loyalty discounts though, like a free fitting or mobile fitting once every few tyres."
Lowest price and fitted at a place that could accommodate our motorhome heighth that provided immediate service as per booking!
Price and Service was good. All went to plan.
Reasonable price and good service.
"Cheap prices, prompt service & good selection of tyres across a wide price range."
The tyres are cheaper than buying from the garage that fits them.Straight forward convenient and no reason to go anywhere else
Nice and easy to use website with plenty of choice and options. Prices are also competitive and lots of local garages on the list for fitting.
Great to get a comparison of tyres on offer and prices
Good Prices Quick delivery. Easy to use website
"Easy, good prices, offers"
Good service and excellent value
"experience spoiled by wait for wheel alignment. Garage booked a specific time for the tyre change, which was good. But then had to wait ages for the wheel alignment. So that spoiled the experience. In total I was at the garage over two hours."
The service was excellent. I had ordered the wrong tyres and they got the right ones out to me very quickly. Polite and helpful service over the phone too.
"Great prices. Dealt with [REDACTED] a few times and have never had any problems , great prices and service ."
I bought 4 tyres in Ormskirk branch and requested to check my brakes. They didn't check. Why? I'm very disappointed.
"Very simple process, i had to ring the garage to confirm the time but that worked well as well."
Tyres have so far been great!Impressed with [REDACTED] and the slick way the website navigates you as well as getting them delivered to my local garage for fitting. Will definately be coming back!
"Do not use Very poor customer service. Yes, the tyres they sell are at a more competitive price than the manufacturer of my car however their customer service is appalling. I spent almost £300 on new tyres and booked a fitting slot for the Wednesday the following week only to receive an email literally 24hrs in advance saying there was a delay on my order. There was no explanation for the delay and they rebooked me a new slot without even phoning me to discuss a suitable day. As a result I had to take a day off work to accommodate this as I couldn’t postpone the fitting any longer. I replied to their customer service teams email stressing my dissatisfaction to never receive an explanation or compensation for the delay. This is not acceptable customer service when someone is spending hundreds of pounds they expect to receive the goods on the day they were promised. Definitely wouldn’t use [REDACTED] again!"
Smooth transaction from start to finish and a good price too.
First and last time using. Used for the first time and would not use again. The garage I had the tyres sent to damaged two rims on my car and between the garage and [REDACTED] weren’t interested and basically said the damage was caused by myself from an impact rather than from tyre machine. Had tyres fitted at ATS on previous occasions and no such issue so lesson learned from using [REDACTED] and approved fitters in the future.
"Would Definitely use again. Excellent price, easy ordering and arranging fitting at local garage, Carmaster, Harrogate. Will definitely use both again!!"
Good customer service!
I was told my tyre had not arrived at the garage for my initial appointment the night before the appointment. I then had to call [REDACTED] to find out how to rectify this issue. They told me the tyre had arrived at the garage and I needed to call the garage. I called the garage who then informed me that the tyre was not there. I then had to get back in touch with [REDACTED] for them to speak again to the garage. I was then informed that the tyre was there and my appointment was rescheduled to take my car in any time after 12pm. I arrived for the garage to tell me my appointment was at 1pm and needed to go away and come back. I have not been impressed with [REDACTED].
Good price and service from your partner garage
Excellent Service as Always. As an existing customer reordering tyres is so quick and easy. Great communication and HiQ tyre centre in Plymouth is great.

"Price good, ordering process was quick and easy."
I'm pretty sure the tyres that were fitted in my car were not brand new
"Good prices, prompt fitment"
Good service but to expensive
The Pricing is very competitive and service offered by by local garage is excellent
If it is a non emergency then [REDACTED] is a competitive way to get tyres replaced.
"Great all round. Great price, quick, timely and polite service. Will definitely use again and highly recommend."
"Best price, easy to use, no hassles. Tyres were fitted at Mcconechys st Clair street Aberdeen and they were first class with their service"

First class service from the garage. Good range of tyre to choose from at affordable prices.

"Great service, great price."
"Couldn’t fault the service, tyres fitted quickly Everything good."
2 young guys so very helpful. nothing to much trouble and as I've said very helpful
I haven't found anyone yet to beat [REDACTED] prices for branded tyres and the website is easy to use and appointments are easy to book.
"Great selection of both budget and high end tyres. Easy online booking and payment, no phone calls required, whats not to like?"
Great choice of tyres in all price ranges. Apparently carefully chosen fitting partners that deliver a excellent service. And the ordering process couldn't be easier. If you need assistance it's right there.
"Excellent range of tyres at great prices, ordering on line is easy. Fitted by a local garage who are always very good. Used [REDACTED] twice and will definatley do so again."
excellent service garage very good and polite.
"Good price, simple system."
"Good price from [REDACTED], excellent fitting from Tolleys"
"Good, efficient and reliable service. Garage was A*"
Very easy to choose tyres and clash of dates for fitting was quickly resolved
Always good prices and service when and were you want.
I felt let down by the service provided by [REDACTED]
Great prices and service
"Not a very good serviceOrdered 2 tyres to be fitted at my local garage on the 3rd Aug, then got email to say the soonest they could be fitted was the 6th Aug. When I spoke to the garage they told me it was because [REDACTED] had sent 2 different size tyres! I has taken them until the 9th August to deliver the correct tyres and the garage have called me to let me know. Not good customer service at all. Just as well I wasn't in a hurry for the tyres!!"
"Cheaper than competition, very easy to book, recommended fitter based upon reviews was excellent."
"Goid Service. Good comparative price and able to use my local garage, much better than going to a Tyre company"
A good price and speedy service
"Excellent service, fantastic fitter!"
Easy transaction and great value.
Good and quality worth price for that and great service superb!!!
Brilliant service at a good price. Well impressed
Good price and excellent service at local garage.
"Easy to book, even if you have to search for the tyre by size, and a reasonable range of places that fit the tyres"
"Spot on, easy to use and a great price. Staff very friendly and engaging."
"Good price, good list of local garages and quick fitting"
Easy to do and saves phoning round garages plus you get a timed appointment for fitting
"Has always been good value, easy to use and the garages you use have always done a good job for me."
Bought tyres online which were marginally better value in comparison to other garages. The fitter did not attach the balancing weights correctly necessitating a revisit but the issue was quickly rectified by the staff.I have used the website previously and will use again.
"Another pair of rainsport 3 for me 225/40/18/ Y for my Astra sri estate through [REDACTED] and had them fitted at my local ATS , had the tracking done too, good job passanger side front was scrubbing bad. Anyway walked in staff very polite and was offered a brew ( nice ) car drove in started job was about 45mins no complaints here , have used ATS 3 or 4 times now and would recommend them as i would [REDACTED]. TOP JOB."
[REDACTED] OK but fitting garage a dead loss.
"5 star. Really quick quote, best value and fast delivery to local fitter."
You cancelled my first appointment because the tyres hadn't arived but you booked me in the day after good service by me thanks
"“Does what it days on the tin” Easy to use website, great price & service"
"Easy to order, fitted quickly at local garage. Very impressed"
"Good prices, good range of tyres, booking a time slot makes it very simple and easy."
A few problems with getting tyres that I ordered but they kept me informed and was happy with the result
"Great Service. So easy, great prices, great service, great communication"
Excellent service and a very fair price
The variety of tyre brands is good as are the prices. The fitting partner was very efficient and the availability of appointment slots was good. Good experience all-round.
"Delivery issues garage uncomplentry about [REDACTED] fitment issues with lack of paperwork. Easy to order, great to talk to but tyres did not arrive to garage on time. Luckily garage used their own stock but admitted frequent delivery delays so unsure it given same tyre rating as ordered.No paperwork provided when job done and wheel bolt snapped off during fitting so had to purchase replacement myself.Garage did fit it free of charge when i returned but had been told OK to drive car without it which was shocking as doing a 250km round trip that day. Price great value but garage partner did not give good impression."
[REDACTED] good. [REDACTED] always works for me. Competitive prices and easy local fitting.
"highly recomended. Easy to use web site, kept informed of order, fitted by local garage with no problems. On top of all this got 10% off,especially good when you are buying four tyres."
Fine until you have a problem. Had a problem with a fault in a Uniroyal tyre after around 500 miles. I wasn't impressed with the [REDACTED] complaints process which was chaotic and unprofessional. Their main aim seemed to be to be to find/claim some imaginary damage on the tyre and so disallow the claim.
Good price good service
Very cheap and efficient way of replacing tyres. First order and appt was cancelled due to low stock but this was effectively rectified
"Always a nice and easy experience. Type in reg, pick tyres, wait a couple days and get them fitted. Saves the hassle of phoning around and usually the cheapest anyways. Thanks [REDACTED]"
"Very efficient service, waiting area clean as were the toilets"
A great and hasslefree service. I was recommended your tyre replacement service by my local garage. It was so simple to find the right size of tyres for my car as all I had to do was enter my car registration number. It was hassle free as I booked a suitable appointment for the tyre replacement all at the same time. All I had to do was turn up at my local garage where the tyres had already been delivered. All was done at no extra cost. Thanks for such a great and hassle-free service.
"The product was great but the service, although polite, was really inconsistent and lead to mistakes being made"
"Easy to use website, easy to select the relevant tyres and easy to find the best place to get them fitted"
Great price and great service
good service good prices
"Service, delivery, and customer service at fitting point was excellent"
"My 2 tyres saved me about £100, and that is amazing.Even the tyre fitters said they could not buy the same tyres for what I paid for them."
"Great service, great price what more can you want , guy that changed tyres was polite and quick"
I chose a Saturday slot and was told can't do that will have to be Monday and eventually had my tyres fitted on Tuesday
"Prices were competitive, but the fitting times changed and the information that I was given was different to the garage"
Best price. No hastle fitting service.
"I have bought several tyres in the past through [REDACTED] and always been happy with the service. However, on this occasion I had to return to ATS Cleckheaton two days later for them to rebalance the wheels as the vibration was intolerable. I was also disappointed that the tyre pressures were all incorrect and out by 6lb on the same axle."
Was happy with the price & the [REDACTED] service. Unhappy with the garage that where highly rated on [REDACTED].
Very prompt and most of staff were friendly
"Website easy to use,plenty of choice of tyres and places to have them fitted and competitive prices."
You only delivered one of my tyres to the garage so I had to visit twice
Generally great service. of the 2 members of the staff that were at the center one was rude.
"Great mid range tyres at a good price, probably a slightly softer ride on 20 inch rims which is no bad thing.Garage were excellent as usual, replacing my space saver and fitting that back into the wheel well in the boot which is fiddly."
"Tyres were well priced, but the garage was on a go slow, took over an hour to get fitted, was only one other customer in front of me"
"Excellent service. Quick, easy and cheaper than high street. Highly recommend"
"Good, reliable service at a competitive price."
Online experience was good but fitment service by your pit stop in Milton Keynes was poor
"Shocking service. I ordered four tyres on 25 June to be fitted on 4 July. On the evening of 3 July I had a phone call telling me the tyres hadn't been delivered to the garage. On 4 July I had several emails from different Customer Service staff telling me differing things - I was re-booked for Sat 6 July, I was re-booked for Mon 8 July... in the end I had to call but the person I spoke to still didn't really know what was going on. I demanded my tyres be fitted on 6 July. Thankfully they were. I had arranged my work around d the fitting on 4 July and had to instead use part of my weekend instead. I won't be using [REDACTED] again."
Everything as arranged. Even a free coffee whilst I waited:-))
"EASY SIMPLE. I was waiting for the depot to open at 8am and was the first customer of the day. I handed over the receipt, my car keys and the location of the wheel lock device and went to a cafe to get a coffee. I returned 30 minutes later and my car was parked outside with one new tyre as ordered. Simple!"
Very easy to book and simple to fit and so many garages to choose from. So simple and hassle free
"Mid range tyres. The mid range tyres I bought 2 years ago started cracking in the treads,I contacted [REDACTED] who agreed they must have been faulty & refunded me 60 % ,towards a new set,which I didn’t have to buy from them but I did ( a higher spec) & so far so good. So can’t knock their customer service."
"Excellent service, good price, convenient location. Not 5 stars as an independent was a couple of pounds per tyre cheaper - but the location was not as convenient."
Great savings on a premium tyre
"The lady that dealt with me was especially helpful, polite and courteous. I had a query about work I had been told would need doing and the lady arranged for my car to be put up on a ramp where a mechanic could take a look who assured me there wasn't a lot to worry about at this stage which put my mind at ease. I was very impressed with the way I was treated."
"Fantastic service. Arrived 15 mins early and car was taken straight away to change tyre. Friendly service, keep up the good work!"
Easy selection of tyre type at a very competitive price. Pleased to be able to select my referred fitting location. All in all a slick and easy process.
"Great price, easy to order and fitting"
1. Today if you can buy the very same product cheaper it makes common sense to. 2. I saved over £82.00 on 2 tyres fitted in the same premises where I would of paid more. 3. Using the website was easy straight forward and the whole experience was good.
Excellent. Good selection of tyres on website with detailed information on specification. Local fitting at ATS. Efficient and helpful. Good price.
"Easy to order but cheaper at the garage. Great to compare tyres, very easy you use and able to pay with PayPal but found it was cheaper to buy directly the same tyre at the garage."
Useful service. Saves phoning round for the tyre you want. I just took the wheel to the garage and 10 mins later it was all done.
"Ease of ordering, choice of tyres, good price and local fitters."
"nice, great customer service, fast and to the point"
Quick and easy to order. The garage could not fit my tyres during the time slot I selected during the purchase but [REDACTED] kept me informed all the time and communicated promptly
"Very good customer service, timely appointment and very accomodative"
Great service spot on times and veey. Great service spot on times and very helpful staff
"Easy ordering, keen prices. I just need a fitting service a little nearer to home."
"very good. [REDACTED] were great, they gave me clear options of tyres that fitted my wheels, gave clear instructions on what to bring to my appointment, sent me text reminders close to my appointment etc.. and my overall experience with them was very easy :)"
"I could not fault either the service I received or the speed and quality of fitting....first class all around, highly recommended to anyone not aware of [REDACTED] value for money and customer care!"
"Big savings without trawling google endless phone calls. Very easy to use & understand what you want, I’ve saved over £200 on four tyres through this site, and still able to use the same tyre place. Love a great deal with great service 🤪"
good service all round would of been 10 except for grumpy fitter
"Class Leading price and service. I could not fault either the service I received or the speed and quality of fitting....first class all around, highly recommended to anyone not aware of [REDACTED] value for money and customer care!"
"Job Done. Great service, quality and price. Wish fitting garage was a bit closer."
New front tyres for BMW 435. Happy with service and advice given by the sales team.Prompt and hassle free.
"Whole process was much easier than I thought it would be, I knew the tire I wanted would be 'in stock' when I got there and it was cheaper than anywhere else!"
Easy and simple service to use. Tyres look good.
"Poor organisation of service. I booked a slot, it was confirmed. Then I was emailed to say it had to be changed to 2 days later. Then they turned up on the original (cancelled) time slot when we were of course not in, then I had to rearrange it with them for a third different time. Lots of wasted time, when I was hoping for a convenient service. No goodwill discount or compensation offered - I asked for some discount, they agreed but never gave it!"
Best tyres is in here
Service was horrendous. The staff mislead me. Still after 2 weeks waiting for a refund.
Delivered as advertised. Good tyres.
Good quick service. Good local garage.
"We were badly let down by [REDACTED]. On Thursday 11th July we arranged with [REDACTED] to come Saturday morning (13th July) to replace a punctured tyre. Received an email Friday afternoon saying tyre hadn’t been delivered so couldn’t do the job Saturday morning and it couldn’t be done before the following Wednesday at the earliest! Totally unacceptable. It was too late to contact [REDACTED] then so we phoned Saturday morning and was told the fitter would come that morning as arranged. We agreed to that but said we had to travel to Manchester at lunchtime. No-one had turned up by 11.45 so we phoned again and was told fitter would be with us by 1.00-1.15. Still no show, so phoned again at 2.00pm and was told he would be with us by 3.00pm. Still no show so we left home, making alternative travel arrangements and being disappointingly late for the event we had planned. Rang [REDACTED] again Monday morning and was told fitter would come at 1.00pm. He finally arrived at 3.45 that afternoon. Totally unacceptable service although the people on the phones seemed to do all the could to help."
Found a good choice of tyre delivered and fitted at my local garageNo problems2nd time using [REDACTED]
No tyres when I turned up for fitting
"Tyres was fit with high pressure and looks like old dirty tyre all around, at least they could put some tyre shine for better quality of service!!"
Had problems with garage booking and was sorted out efficiently
Very reliable and good quality tyres. No issues at all.
Well done Mr Tyre. Very easy process to shop for all inclusive price for supply and fitting at a location and time to suit yourself. Friendly staff quickly complete the job and your on your way.
So easy to order free fitting at a local garage and didn't have to wait as I work shifts I left my car with them an picked it up before they closed. Will definitely never go back to any other tyre place than [REDACTED].com
Booked on line. Went to garage & tyres were fitted. Very efficient
Great price and superb service
"Speedy, efficient service. Qutue a lot cheaper than the other quotes I got and the user reviews for the individual tyres was very helpful!"
"Straight Forward. Did a search on the net for the best price for 195 tyres. [REDACTED] came up. Ordered, Payed, got a date at a garage a couple of miles away from where I live. Turned up, waited about 30 mins, got car back, went home. Absolute doddle.Next time if [REDACTED] comes up competitive I will use them again."
"The whole process is seamless, and the prices are very reasonable."
The garage and service given is very good.
"Tyres and fitting. Four tyres ordered on the website after selecting the quality from the comprehensive range proffered. Acknowledgement of the purchase was almost instant, quickly followed by confirmation of the time slot for fitting on my chosen day. On arrival at Wheels and Tyres Direct, Beccles, Suffolk, at the nominated time I was quickly attended to and the staff were fully aware of the order and had the tyres ready. Although purchased from a 3rd party, the staff were extremely helpful an very courteous at all times. I had enjoyed a trouble-free, and cost-effective, purchasing experience. I can fully recommend [REDACTED], and Wheels and Tyres direct in Beccles, to any prospective customer. My thanks to all."
Good value tyres with the fitting fee going to local independent shop. Win for me on both counts.
"The online process was easy to use, the communication post order was excellent and the depot chosen gave excellent service"
"Good value, easy to use website, good range of local fitters"
"Service is excellent, prices are excellent also."
Excellent service. Bit of a hiccup with getting the tyre delivered initially but this was resolved quickly and the tyre was fitted really quickly. Price was excellent too. Would recommend and would use again.
You got what was on the packet. Not the best deal possible but a reasonably fair deal
Vv good quick and efficient.
No hassle choice your time garage turn up
First class service. First class product. First class price. Fitting station was just fine. Communication and customer service with [REDACTED] was professional and customer orientated. Will return without hesitation.
Excellent service. Easy to navigate website and foundtyres required at reasonable price . Delivered next day and ATS garage fitted them in Peterborough. The fitters Dave and Mark were really helpful and I couldn't ask for better service
"All very simple, delivery and fitting went smoothly and all to plan."
First class except for being advised tyres would not arrive in time for fitting appointment when they did in fact arrive in time wasting a day.
"Easy purchase, prompt delivery, excellent communication backed by excellent service at Wheels and Tyres Direct, Beccles."
"Easy to use web site, best prices for my tyres and loads of fitting centres"
Ordered tyres based upon a booked fitting day which was then changed after order confirmation
Excellent service updates all the time via email and then garage done a great job on time and efficient
"great service and delivery. Special mention to 1st Class tyres and autos of Lutterworth, who fitted the tyres without problem. great customer service, nothing too much trouble for them. Would recommend."
"Good value and customer service, both online and at fitting garage."
Online process was excellent; only 8 as the garage was unable to fit the tyres in the allotted time and I had to wait over an hour.
Brilliant service great price
"Spot on. Ordered the tyres to be fitted at the local garage. Turned up, tyres fitted, went home.[REDACTED] is perfect. Always has good prices. I will 100% use again."
easy to check and order and get it fitted locally
Great tyres and great service for a great price would definitely use again
good prices and quick work at garage
"Good price, great service, very convenient not having to wait around while your tyres are changed. Home service I e price very reasonable."
"Quick and easy to book in the tyres, price is as quoted with no hidden extras"
Easy to use the site and the prices were the best in the market
Excellent service good price
Execellent service. No problems. Be aware that some tyre fitters will try to sell extra services!
"After an initial cancellation, the re-book went very smoothly. Tyres good value for money and fitted with a minimum of fuss."
The website is really easy to use and navigating is effortless. Excellent service and the prices are fabulous.
I have used [REDACTED].com a number of times and have always found them to best the prices on the internet. They are very convenient to use as they have numerous fitting shops around the country.
Easy purchase. Easy to book appointment. Great quality. Good price.
Good rice & service. Convenient
wide choice and very easy to compare tyres both prices and performance
Good choice of tyres at cheap prices
"So easy to use, you can compare tyre performance and prices & have your tyre/tyres replaced when and where suits you."

Good selection of tyre fitting times. Clear instructions/information. Punctual and fast fitting with no issues.
Great price and easy to use. [REDACTED] made buying tyres easy and it was great to have a choice of local garages to fit them.
"New tyres. The ordering, and the service and fitment were hassle free, although it appeared there was some confusion as to the tyres I ordered, all good."
Very simple to choose the right tyres for your car & arrange fitting too from a reputable garage. All worked seamlessly. Will definitely use your site again

Very efficient service & the best price for tyres.
Tyre selection and fitting made easy
Easy to navigate website and convenient to choose a local place to fit the tyres
Polite service. Efficient and very easy to organise. Thankyou
Excellent service. Mobile fitter very professional clean and tidy.

My experience at the tyre fitters was disappointing
Good value and convenient to book in tyre fitting.
"Easy and well Priced. Easy to use website, found the tyres at good prices, with reviews and fitting options. Overall a great experience."
Excellent service and best value tyres. Beat all competitor prices. Fitting service @ ATS was good too. Very happy
Easy ordering process and good service.
Brilliant service and much cheaper compared to the nearest competitor

Very competitive prices and the garage was excellent
"Eastcote, Cheap , great service"
Excellent prices and service.
"Simple process, good price, tyres delivered as arranged. Excellent service"
Superb service from Wiltshire Tyres mobile fitting through [REDACTED]. Will definitely use again.
"I've used [REDACTED] several times over the last 10 or so years. My car, my wife's car and our motorhome. On every occasion I saved money and the choosing and fitting process was simple. One fitting centre (also a tyre supplier of course) had quoted me about £150/tyre, compared with £120 from [REDACTED]. They were then the fitting centre that I chose, so they made a small profit from the fitting but nothing from the supply. Crazy, but I'm certainly not passing up the chance to get, effectively, one free tyre for every three I buy from [REDACTED]."
"I needed 2 new tyres, very easy to select and buy on the website. Garage excellent unfortunately I hit a pothole and needed another one and was booked in for the Saturday and the garage done them all together."
"Great service efficient, friendly and offered advice on other items for my car."
"Good service, reliable and good quality"
Good product at good prices
Simple to do and great priced.
"Prices were competitive, straight forward to order and pay. Could get tyres from a local centre which as we've just moved to this area was a bonus, would deferently recommend and use again."
Excellent value and service
"Ease of use online on selecting the right tyre for my budget. useful info on tyre grades, wide choice, competitve prices, lots of local garages for fitting."
"It was trouble free ordering process, fitting at time & place suitable to me. Hassle free"
"I was very pleased with the ease of use of the website, the service from [REDACTED] and the fitting of the tyres"
Absolutely no problems. A fair price and excellent service from the garage that fitted my four new tyres.
Good price good service will definitely use them again
"A great company to deal with. A good choice of premium and budget tyres, well priced and easy to order and arrange fitting."
"I ordered 2X tyres to replace the front 2, but Dan looked at all of my tyres and recommended which needed replacing to save me money on replacing tyres that didn't need replacing. He was very quick and efficient and very friendly."
Excellent service and values impressed. Excellent service and value
"Easy, price and service"
"The best . Super easy website to navigate, the best price and choice of local fitters....couldn't be better"
"Easy to find. Easy to to find the right tyres on the web site very user friendly, Excellent service from garage when tyres were being fitted"
Great Service and Tyre Prices. I needed 2 new front tyres for My Mercedes[REDACTED] gave me the best quote for identical tyres to those fitted from new by the factory.Lots cheaper than the dealer.Simple to orderThey arrived on timeTheir approved fitter stuck to the appointment time All was hassle free 5 Stars service score well deserved.
"Absolutely no problems encountered, all as it was supposed to be. Good price, garage itself is one I occasionally use anyway so know and trust."
"Excellent service, had a question on tyre codes which was swiftly dealt with via contact us section, before I ordered the tyres.Very good value for money, highly recommended 🤗"
Great Value and service. Fitted at work with no lost time.Very happy :-)
"Great service, cheapest price and reliable trustworthy agent!"
Good service. ATS were very helpful.
"Seamless experience with mobile tyre fitter doing a great, quick job"
because they are efficient and good value for money
"Good service, good garage."
Very good professional and price competitive service
Great price and good service from my selected garage.
Ease of use with very competitive prices
Easy to use good prices
Not brilliant fitting service
"Fast, efficient service and SO much cheaper than going direct to local garage, even though I can use the same garage for fitting! It's a no brainer 😃"
"Easy, quick and hassle free, and a tyre for every budget"
Great site and dead easy to usehighly recommended. Great site and dead easy to use. Prices are definitely cheaper than at the same retailers in my area (that fit them via [REDACTED]). We had a minor problem over appointment time but BC we're on the case immediately I told them.
I received excellent service both friendly no nonsense a pleasure to do business with.
"The service was just excellent and second to none. Firstly, [REDACTED].com was among the top 3 cheapest for the brand I wanted. Secondly, I chose to have them fitted at one of the best tyre company in my town. Win Win all round"
"Good tyres at a good price. Turn up at the time and place , as requested by myself, (Singlewell service station) . Have a cup of tea whle I wait. Drive away fully satisfied. What could be better!? So easy which makes a nice change."
Utterly useless. I used [REDACTED] to purchase some tyres. The entire experience was unsatisfactory and the supplier they used conducted sub standard work and then tried to blame me. I complained to [REDACTED] and received an automated response to say they would acknowledge my complaint within one working day. This they have failed to do. If they have a complaints charter then they should at least abide by it. I will not use them again.
"Fitting Was re-scheduled twice, once at very short notice."
Very good service. Tyres are great value for money and compared to the same top branded tyre for the same spec would definitely use again.
Excellent service and very competitive prices. Using my local garage for fitting a major factor in using [REDACTED]
"Prices are good, service is excellent and the process is super-convenient"
"I have been using [REDACTED] for a number of years good prices and it is so easy, pick your tyres and garage pay and turn up on your selected date. I will continue to use [REDACTED] and would recommend them to anyone."
"good prices, good service, most importantly you could provide the actual tyres I wanted. People like Kwik fit could only provide an alternative and not replace the tyres on the car."
"Good prices, plenty of customer reviews on the product purchased and other helpful guidance/advice too"
Was recommended. Website easy to use and tyre fitting excellent.
Happy with cost and easiness to purchase
Good tyres at a affordable price
top Job. Used before will use againGood price great service
Good service inc discount on tyres...
"Great value great service will use again in the future. Very good value, prompt service, well impressed with the garage in Woldingham (Christian cars) where the tyres were fitted, Becky managed to fit me in quickly as I was on a tight timescale - very helpful and easy to deal with.Overall very impressed, which I don’t say often, would definitely use again"
"Best prices, lots of choice. Never fail to deliver and never disappoint."
Very professional service and reasonable price
"Excellent service. Quick, good price and hassle free."
Good service and good price
"Wide choice of tyres, competitive price and pleased with the garage I chose for fitting."
Easy to order. Agents close by
"Simply great. Great price, £150 cheaper than equivalent tyres from high street, fab service (fitted at home), then won the cost of my tyres back. What is not to love?Thank you [REDACTED]"
Fair price and bookable
Appointment change once booked. I made an appointment online and then a day later was told I couldn't have it and would have to make another appointment for 2 days later. As this was for an MOT re-test it meant I couldn't use the car for two days. There was nothing on the site about possible rearranging of appointments.
First consideration price but the whole process simple and straightforward.
Very good service and value for money.
"Excellent prices and service.I have used [REDACTED] several times over recent years. I require quality high performance tyres and they have ALWAYS been the lowest price compared to all other suppliers online. On the most recent purchase I had an issue ( not BC’s fault, but my own error ) and they contacted me as I requested and they resolved the issue I had straight away - how customer service should be. I have also never had any problems when I have attended one of their many fitting partners - also have the option for the fitters to come to the customer for a reasonable £6 extra charge - I’ve never used that option so can’t comment on its quality. Out of curiosity I asked the recent fitting centre I had used how much the tyre supply and fitmeant would cost if I bought the tyre from them. I was surprised to hear that their fully fitted price for the exact same tyre would have been £75 more ! I have no hesitation in recommending them to others - I hope they don’t allow their prices to rise, they remain competitive, and their customer service standards stay high."
Used BC few times over the last few years - they have consistently been the lowest price for top quality brands. My car requires high performance tyres and they have always stocked what I need. Huge number of convenient fitters and also a mobile option. I’ve never had any issues with the service provided by BC or their fitting suppliers
Mainly because when my wife turned up at the garage with my 3 year old son the garage had only been sent 3 of the correct tyres. So my wife had to wait for an hour before the 4th tyre arrived. The garage told us they had contacted you the day before when the wrong tyre had arrived so you could let me know but I never had any contact from [REDACTED] regarding this. It was only by chance the tyre turned up as my wife was about to leave. Not very impressed with her having to wait around when everything was booked especially having our young son with her. Coming back was not really an option as we had things planned hence booking the time we did.
You had tyres that I wanted that I couldn't get from local suppiers and the fitting company where excellent
"Very easy to use, good selection of tyres and no need to mess around with payment on the day. Finance options also available which can be useful."
Quick easy and efficient. No further costs from the garage . Using them again .
Very easy to organise new tyre; Great garage fitted them; Cheapest price
"Awful. Arranged a 9am appointment to fit the tyres and they didn't get fitted until 16:30pm. Wouldn't use again, terrible service. Save yourself the hassle and just ring and book direct with a garage."
Easy to use website and communication good when slot I booked with local fitter was unavailable despite being accepted and confirmed. Prices excellent. Speed from booking to fitting excellent. Only poor service was my wheels were left in a filthy state following fitting which was fitter not [REDACTED].
"Good range of tyres available, good prices, numerous convenient fitting locations, no hidden fees."
"Because everything was so easy, the product and the price were both right"
Price Service
Value for money
Took. numerous phone calls chasing a change of time/date for appointment. Told on morning by staff that I was booked in and someone had just forgot to send confirmation but when I got to the garage I wasn’t booked in and had to return another time.
"Ordered Tuesday for Thursday, but you failed to do anything but till I phoned late Wednesday. IE phone fitting centre and then send confirmation email to me."
It is the cheapest and easiest way I have found to get new tyres fitted to my car.
It’s easy to use. I can sort out the tyres we wanted for the wife’s car and pay for them. She just has to turn up at the right time with the car and voila.
good efficient service at a competative price
"Your customer service is awful, you never get back to your customers and you are unreliable"
"Easy to buy from, fitting appointment worked very well"
Very easy to choose tyres online and pick an appropriate fitting station
Concerned that tyres fitted were not brand new. No new tyre lines on any of the 4 Michelin pilot 4’s recently purchased.
"Second time using [REDACTED], easy to make bookings and reliable service."
"Sometimes time is better spent on tasks other than ringing around to find the best tyre deal. Options, reviews and a simple fitting arrangement package make buying through [REDACTED] an easy and quick task."
I had my tyres fitted on Friday 5th July with the mobile service. Tyres were not balanced correctly & vibration was so bad it was undriveable . It's now the 15th & I'm still waiting to get them re-balanced. It's a ridiculous.
"The jury is out, you massively messed up my booking. A customer services agent did resolve the issue, but it took several emails, and phone calls and time. I also think my wheel go damaged but very stupidly I did not take a pre and post picture. So at the moment I don't think I've had good value for money, I feel like I've had to try and fix your problem and 5 is a very strong score!!"
"Nice and easy, best price as well."
"Wide range of garages, cheap tyres as usual.. what more can you ask for"
How long the garage took to do the work
Great Value. I wanted 2 new mid range tyres. I went to a local discount tyre fitters and they quoted me £68 for an unknown brand.[REDACTED] sold me a decent brand for the much less.Would recommend them.
Great prices (probably saved around £40 on two tyres) and excellent easily navigated website. Fast efficient and courteous service from the fitting garage. Highly recommended!
Easy to purchase. Great to have a time slot and a friendly garage
"Continuing disappointment. The garage I chose on their website was not equipped to fit my tyres.Appointment was rescheduled venue & time without consulting me first.Waited for one hour from my allotted fitting time before they started work.Took 30 minutes to fit two tyres, which, although I'm no expert, seems excessive.Lack of contact throughout my customer experience, however they seem very impatient to receive my feedback, which I'm sure will shortly be removed, being As it is not positive."
"Delighted to have found [REDACTED]. I saved almost £100 per tyre by using them instead of going to the garage.Simple & easy to use web site and great organisation. Everything went like clockwork. No waiting around, the garage had my appointment did my tyres and I was out in no time.Brilliant."
ease of buying. Easy to purchase tyres from [REDACTED] and competitive prices.The tyre fitting was done by BTS garage Adfa an excellent servce.
"Great Service and great garage - professional, friendly, and very efficient. I will certainly be using this service and garage again"
"very pleased with the service from [REDACTED], tyres were at the garage on time and fitted. Excellent"
Excellent service gr8 prices
"Great services, good prices. quick and easy to order on line and the tyres were delivered to my chosen fitting station on time. Thank You [REDACTED]."
Excellent price and service no fuss plus you can choose a garage near to you from a list provided
[REDACTED]. Excellent service throughout with good prices.
"excellent prices, good service and communication...Job Done :)"
"Excellent service Thanks. Very helpful speedy service and, tyres at a really competitive price. Thanks to the fitters at Kingsbridge."
"The garage didn't balance the tyres correctly, messed with my cars wheel alignment.Ended up having to get another garage to perform an emergency repair on my car and now have to take the car to BMW to get the wheel alignment corrected.The tyres still need balanced but will be taken the garage to court for damages and losses."
Excellent service and prices. Straightforward purchase and fitting.
The service I received was first class and the cost was very competitive.
Really simple and efficient . Really simple way to choose your tyres and buy your tyres with multiple options for fitting (or not) at times to suit. Never again turning up hoping they have the right tyres and the time!
"Very simple to use website and excellent service from the approved garage, West Malling Garage in Kent."
Great service and efficient and friendly fitting agents. Also good value for tyres.
Excellent service from start to finish at very competitive price
"The service received by [REDACTED] was second to none, just a shame the garage I used wasn't so good."
very good service and no fault with garage thank you
"A very user friendly booking system, comprehensive & easy to navigate website, a totally professional service that I wish I had known about earlier!"
"Easy website to use, a good range of tyres at competitive prices, a fitting service designed to accommodate the purchaser, all in all a satisfying experience. Thanks [REDACTED], I will be back"
Convenient. Decent price.
"Fantastic experience! Great service, lovely product, and super fast shipping!"
Very nice chaps fitted my tyre even though I was an hour late
Cheaper than the rest and everything went smoothly 👍
Me & my girlfriend have used [REDACTED] for many years & cannot fault them. Fantastic service & great prices. The garage who fit the tyres are excellent as well
Very pleased. Great service. New tyres look good. Garage used was exellent.
"Great price, quick fitting, great service"
"Excellent Value. Excellent value for money for tyres for a Mercedes C180 AMG 125 Sport Edition, combined with great service from ATS Euromaster."
"Youll struggle to find better choice quality prices and service. This is an excellent way to replace your worn out tyres. The procedure is efficient, organised and well-priced. I'm a pensioner and I've been driving for years, [REDACTED] is one of the best and most efficient companies I have encountered for price, quality and service"
"Good price, fitted and on my way in half an hour. Highly recommended."
[REDACTED] tyres. I found with [REDACTED] I got the tyres I wanted and for £15 cheaper than anywhere else
Easy and quick. Easy and price won’t be beaten!
Excellent value. Will use [REDACTED] again and again every time.
"Great choice, good price, simple to arrange fitting what.more do you need?!?!"
Great service. Everything was perfect even the very friendly garage I chose
"Best price, easy to organise fitting and customer service quick to resolve an issue with appointment made at independent garage."
Ordered 2 tyres to be delivered and fitted to my local garage as the same garage could not compete with prices for the exact same tyres
Very helpful fair price.
"Excellent website, great prices and the fitter was friendly and helpful"
"easy smooth transaction. Fitted by local garage quick and easy. Will use both [REDACTED] and Lieziate Drove Garage, Pott Row. Many thanks"
"[REDACTED] for Tyres recommended. Good prices, local install."
Good prices great service
"Will use again. Simple, quick and a good price."
"All work done as agreed, and garage were very helpful."
"Hassle free, great value way of replacing tyres."
Replaced worn tyres without any problems.The recommended garage were great.
Simple process and good to choose tyres according to noise and weather ratings
Good price on the tyre Excellent fitting All ran like clockwork
The process was easy and the savings were good.
"Ease of access, clear descriptions of the tyre options and then a selection of local garages to use."
Good price. Very convenient locations. Easy to arrange service
Ease of booking and wide range of reasonably priced products
[REDACTED] were fine ATS were appealing and my wheel was left in dreadful mess
Couldn’t fault the experience very easy and a very good service by the garage
Good price and quick and efficient service. Thanks
Good price for tyres and great service from Seapark Garage at Kinloss.
Good price. Excellent service. Easy.
Black n Rounds in Silverstone are excellent.
Fitting centre behind time and not ready for my appointment
"Your fitter Ray was extremely helpful, did his job well quickly, and professionaly, good service best prices thanks."
Good prices and quick service
Great price and faultless service. Nothing more to add!
Good pricing and great efficiency of the garage in Cramlington fitting the tyres. In and out in 25 mins for two tyres on alloys.
Quick easy purchase and appointment made with local tyre depot. On the day received excellent service and the tyres were excellent value for money.
Because there was a manufacturing error in your tyre. I ordered two apollo tyres got them fitted and the same one of the tyre start losing air. I got it check and found out there was a tiny tiny whole in wall of the tyre which was not done by any puncture or anything. Had to buy another tyre on the spot.
Absolute Tops! Highly recommended. Had mobile fitter out to who was extremely helpful and efficient. Worked perfectly as tyres were fitted whilst at work.
Very happy with service and value. Missed one star off as booked for a Tuesday initially but next day was informed garage couldn't do fitting till Thursday. Was not an issue and [REDACTED] is working hard to make such issues a thing of the past. But for a fair review I thought I must deduct the one star for this inconvenience as for some people could cause an issue.
"Excellent prices, tyres fitted on my driveway. Will use again in the future."
Fantastic service right from booking the tyre and the mechanic coming to fix it
Easy to use site Can put in your car index to find tyre size req but advisable to double check Did have an issue with the chosen garage not accepting the job no but staff at [REDACTED] did sort it after I called ( was a bit miffed the email sent to me was 5 mins before closing the night before the elected date) All worked out in the end and the garage confirmed [REDACTED] do a great price on tyres Would use again but I will call the nominated garage ahead to make sure they have the job/ tyres acknowledged
"Tyres did not arrive at my chosen garage in time for my appointment, however [REDACTED] kept me informed and rebooked my appointment for the next day. Luckily i could go into work late that day otherwise it would have been very inconvenient."
"2nd time I've used [REDACTED], and the website is fine, but the fitters have not been great. This time they arrived late and had to reschedule, last time they did not put the alloy protectors on properly and let me drive away with a very low pressure tyre."
"Surprisingly Poor Service. I've used [REDACTED] many times in the past and have been really pleased with the value for money and customer service. It therefore came as a shock to experience really poor service on this occassion.Everything seemed fine at first, my order went though and I was looking forward to having two reasonably priced tyres fitted at a convenient time on a Saturday morning. Later that day I received an email to say the garage could not fit my tyres on the Saturday, that was slightly annoying but OK, I replied to the email to say their suggested fitting day of the following Tuesday would be fine.The next day I receive an email saying they can't deliver my tyres to the garage for the following Tuesday, bearing in mind that it's only Friday at this point and if so why was it even suggested to me as a possible fitting date. Their new suggested day wasn't convenient and I was beginning to feel messed around so I replied saying it was becoming slightly ridiculous now and that I'd have to make alternative arrangements so please cancel the order. Three days later and I still had not received a response or order cancellation from them. I sent an email suggesting rather sternly that they get their act together and cancel/refund my order. It was another day, nearly a wek after the initial order that it was finally cancelled. There was no apology, no explanation, nothing in their email.I really am confused as to why [REDACTED] would think I should use them again or reccommend them to friends or family. Having happily used them before, this is most certainly not the [REDACTED] that I remember."
"Very easy to deal with, good keen rates and do what they say they will. I had home fitting twice in two weeks and the fitter was on time and very polite on both occasions I will definitely be issuing them again!"
"Good quality tyres at a decent price by quality garage staff. Quick, easy and professional."
"excellent service, easy to use and best price"
"Excellent servce. Plenty of choice, easy to buy and plenty of garages to choose from."
Very easy and a fast service. Good price
Good Service & Price
This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] and it has been a trouble free purchase with great service and prices.
"Good value for my tyres, delivered on time and no concerns at all! Thank you."
Excellent prices and experienced fitting centres used
Good Michelin tyres at a good price. Fitting garage also services my Porsche. Known to provide a good service.
"Great price, good quality tyres, local garage that fitted the tyres was first class as well 👍🏻"
I got a reassuring confidence that I was choosing the right tyre at the right price with a known fitting time I selected. That's all I wanted.
Great prices and great backup when the garage you choose is less than competent and mess up your alloy.
Great prices simple process
"Great prices, easy to use website, very helpful staff on the phone"
"Tyres on time. Yes, good product."
"Ordered tyres and booked slot two days later. Then told slot unavailable, so BC rebooked me for 9am Friday. I arrive at the garage, wait 20 minutes, to be told BC have not delivered the tyres. I contact BC who then rebook me for the following Wednesday “am”, which I take to also be 9am as per both other bookings. I arrive at garage to be told appointment is at 10am and get the full story about how busy they are and how I now need to wait an hour when I have guests at home. Not worth the fiver saving over booking directly with a garage, three bookings and double the mileage."
"Full marks to the mobile fitter. Terrible communication for delivery, over week late from date they said they were getting fitted, even on the morning due date [REDACTED] last emailed. If it wasn’t for the mobile fitter communication would of not known. Whole day wasted."
Had got 2 new back tyres all went well they fitting company were great and i managed to get [REDACTED] to come forward with the fitting date which helped me out which i appreciate they did this
Satisfied customer. Best price for the tyres I wanted an excellent service at fitting station.
Such a stress-free way to sort your tyres. Does exactly what it says and was super fast. The guys at the centre couldn’t have been nicer. Highly recommend!!!
"Service 100 percent, fitting station 100 percentPerfectly satisfied with transaction"
"[REDACTED] is the simplest way to buy tyres, visit the website,choose your tyres from their vast range, choose a local tyre fitting company, choose a day, choose a time from available list, and be there for your chosen appointment. Simple! An excellent service."
I ordered 4 tyre's to be fitted decent price for them the only problem was getting them they cancelled and move my fitting day over 4 times because they couldn't deliver the tyre's to the fitting garage on time I originally booked on a Thursday and it went to the following Friday that over a week in the end I cancelled my order they refunded me I when somewhere else . And there customer service is totally pants . They send you a email near the end of day to cancel and move the fitting day without asking you first this happen to me five times before I Had enough and cancelled it . I had to as well because I was going away on the following day after there last fitting day I couldn't take the risk there There fxxking useless stay away don't bother with them they just wasn't your time and money Stay away there just evilThey apologise ok but nothing changes then they have to apologise again in the end if they couldn't get the tyre's to do the job they should of said it straight not after five cancellations even if I meant finding different tyres Absolutely rubbish absolutely atrocious If you want to save time and money and your sanity just look past [REDACTED] tyres on your Google search and find anyone else will be betterJ
"Good clear website, competative prices, good range of fitters. But from my experience the mobile fitter was going to be 2 hours late so had to arrange for another day. Good front end, but I've never had a good experience with the fitters they use."
Great service. Great quick easy service and the cheapest around
Good tyres at a good price. Thankyou
Took my money could not supply mybad news. Took my money could not supply my correct tyre and never replied to four emails
"I have always used [REDACTED], their prices, delivery and choice of tyres are first class."
Great price. Easy to navigate. Good local fitter
"Prices competitive and vast range of garage locations, to make the fitting easy."
"Received email night before tyres were supposed to be fitted, saying delayed could I rearrange fitting to another day!!"
Very straightforward process and good prices.
Good price and professional fitting facilities
"I have bought from [REDACTED] three times online. Easy website to use, good communication perfect tyres."
"One tyre at a time. Ordered two tyres, only one was delivered. Had to drive the car away with one new tyre and return 6 hrs later to have the second fitted when it was delivered."
Best prices and choice of local garages to have them fitted at my convenience.
Fair price. Easy to order. Kept well informed. Fitting arranged locally.
"Great value, choice and sevice"
"Easy web site to use. Decent prices, garage used locally excellent (ATS). Highly recommend."
"Very convenient service, great pricing, easy to arrange and excellent communication. Would highly recommend and definitely use again."
Really poor communication when my order was delayed. No response to emails. Ended up me having to phone them
"Exact tyres I Ordered and fitted when promised. Also, movement of wheels, to my spec, done perfectly. Very knowledgable guys and courteous. Third time I've used the service and will again - have recommended to all of the people I know."
"Well priced, quick, easy and friendly service"
Helpful professional good value
Easy and Very Efficient Process from start to tyre booking at fitting 👍
Very good service arrived early and was taken right away. 8
"Used before and will use again . Used [REDACTED] before and will use again 👍No issues and happy with the simplicity of service through the website and the good choice of tyres on offer, including fitting and appointments available that are local to me.Price is competitive too."
No communication when order delayed. I had to phone up to get an update
Delivery was a day late. Not notified until after 5pm that delivery would not happen as scheduled next day so wasted a day off work!
Very good didn't have tyres in stock so give me higher price ones instead. Thank you [REDACTED].
"[REDACTED] Recommended . I have been using [REDACTED] for the past three years and will continue to use them in the future ,Great value and great service."
Good value and good communication
"Easy, cheap, sorted quickly"
Website is easy to use. I like that by keying in my cars registration the site tells me what tyres I need and the different prices and quality I can choose
"The best prices, easy to use website"
"Good service, great price"
So easy to find the required tyre(s) for your vehicle. Self select of fitting venue and day/time. And of course great prices
Great tyre fitting experience.
it worked and gave me a good price
VW Polo Gti. Great service and prices
"Website is easy to use, prices are competitive with other sites and plenty of garages to choose from"
"Another brilliant service! Easy to find the right size, a great variety of tires to choose from with good usable information and a great price! Will be using this service again in the future. Thanks."
"Tyres the easy way. Excellent quality tyres, fitted at home while pouring with rain outside and I just sat on my sofa with a coffee."
"This is the third time I have used [REDACTED], the supply and fitting has always been excellent."
"Good quality well priced tyres, fitted by local garage"
"Very happy with the fitment at BC Bar Hill - Richard was very thorough and did an excellent job, taking car of my car. He even checked with me that I was happy with the torques and tyre pressures that he was using."
Quick easy service at a great cost
The whole experience was both very easy and 100% efficient.I would highly recommend [REDACTED] and would have no hesitation in using them again.
"No trouble. Tyres were waiting as promised. Fitting centre (Wheel In) were courteous, professional and quick."
Every time I get tyres fitted they try & sell me alignment- despite being informed by the dealer my alignment is perfect. Stop the sell ups
Good price on tyres and fitting process worked well.
This is the third time I have used [REDACTED] to replace tires on our cars and once again the value and service has been first class. WE used a fitter that was literally a 5 minute drive from home and it was all done quickly and efficiently.
Because your customer service team are great. I had a problem with a tyre and ATS Ashford but you guys and Protyre Ashford quickly and sympathetically put things right. Well done thank you.
Easy and good value. Easy to arrange and choose appropriate and best value tyres. Tyres delivered to valued garage on time and fitting at garage excellent.
Tyres fitted as planned and on time
"Tyres fitted ok , but some damage to wheel rims . Not worth the hassle reporting it ."
Easy to use web site used local ATS as fit cener excellent service.Only disappointment same fuel efficiency grade as last set brought from blavk circle but getting no where near previous miles per gallon which is costing me as a volunteer patient driver using my own car
"Great quick service for delivery and time frame. Great service from Farnsfield auto centre, for their attention to detail, and for the coffee and chat whilst my tyres were being fitted.Will use both companies again."
I have used [REDACTED] several times. I have used [REDACTED] because they have a good selection of tyres at a fair price. Also they offer fitting near to home again from a selection of work shops.
The fitter was 3 hrs late which caused no end of problems. Gods tyres but won’t be buying from here again.
"The tyres were much cheaper than my local supplier, and the fitting centre I picked were good at their job, no hassles. I'll use them again in a few months for winter tyres."
"2 x Bridgestone Turanza for a reasonable price and included fitting! Could chose a local garage to fit them within 3 days, which was quick service!"
"Competitive price but. Competitive price, on time, would usually recommend. I have used [REDACTED] before and it was five stars service last time. This time I did it on a mobile service. This time, however, I am not sure why the wheel balance was not done perfectly. After a week of install, went on the motorway and the steering vibrates around 60mph +. I took it to the garage after and found out there was an imbalance on the front left. Not expensive to rectify but still required a bit of time and worry."
"Top service. Great response to my mistake , not a problem tyres reordered and given the flash discount on the day of reorder"
Check prices at fitting centre first. On arrival at ATS for fitting I found that it was actually cheaper direct. Called [REDACTED] customer services to enquire about price matching to be told they don't do that. If the cost was within £5 or £10 no problem but £30 was a bit excessive. Definitely investigate prices directly with the fitting centre.
"Cheap quick easy and professional Would recommend. The tyres were cheaper on [REDACTED] than I had seen elsewhere, the process was quick and easy and the person who came to fit my tyre was friendly and professional. All good all round."
"The tyres were cheaper than I had seen them anywhere else, the process was quick and easy and the person who came to fit my tyre was friendly and professional."
Ordered tyres arranged fitting got text the next day to tell me that the date had to be changed i yes I then had to phone to change fitting company
"Super service, plenty of quality tyres to choose from for all budgets."
Great service and arrangements organised very quickly
"Received an email from BC at 16.45 on the day before my booked appointment slot, (because the tyres had not been delivered to the garage in time). I replied to that email asking for the booking to be rescheduled for the following day, but never got a response. Still no response a week later. Ended up having to contact the garage directly in order to get a fitting date. Very poor customer service."
"So easy to order online, the price is good and the fitting was only a garage 4 miles away. I ordered exactly the same tyre as the other one on the front, if you are not sure you can phone up [REDACTED] who will be more than happy to help. Will definitely use again."
Excellent service and a great price for my tyres.
Great service and good value
"Quick, efficient online service at a good price."
"Well priced tyre, suitable fitting time arranged at local garage"
"Convenient, quick, cost effective."
Varied choice. Can view test labels. Choice of fitting dates
"Ease of use, good prices, speed of delivery, choice of fitting centers."
"Trouble free, good price good communications"
I was able to find a local tyre fitter who would have my tyres in stock on the day I went to get them fitted.
"Cheap tyres,great service and simple to use, what's not to like. Thoroughly reccommend."
"Choice, value, website easy to use and plenty of garages to choose from to fit tyres."
Good web site. Good service. Tyres fitted quickly.
Very good price
Simple great service and save over £100 on 2 tyres
Used [REDACTED] several times and enjoyed good service and pricing everytime
You provide a great service and price.
Cheapest price and good service
"The price of tyres were the most competitive, ATS Sandown as the chosen fitter were outstanding."
Great pricing and great service
[REDACTED] was recommended by a friend. Would definitely use [REDACTED] again as it was so easy to order my tyres on line delivered to my local garage then fitted without extra charge.
"Good choice of tyres, competitive prices and excellent service from midway garage, witchford"
Easy to arrange at a reasonable price.
Have used [REDACTED] the last few times I have needed tyres. Always the cheapest and very easy to use. Will definitely continue to use
Good price and local fitting location
Fsst hassle free service and i saved money
Changed my appointment by 2 days with late notice
The tyre fitters badly damaged my alloy wheels
"i ordered 2 tyres from [REDACTED] very reasonable price and a few extra quid to fit at a local garage, garage very friendly and also put wheel trims back on when i left them in the back. would of been 5 stars but i think it may have been better to pick ur day for fitting and a time as the time i was given was to early i did phone garage and they changed my time to fit me in on the day i booked . will buy again and use the same garage again(tyre and auto)."
"A quick and easy way to buy tyres at a good price. The local fitting centre did a great job and took care of my car, ensuring that the pressures and bolt torque was spot on."
"simple no fuss. Ordered online the tyres that I required , there was a 10% discount , 3 days later had them fitted at a garage near to where I live. I arrived at the garage 10 minutes early ,the gentleman that I spoke to was friendly and polite and took the car straight away and had fitted them by the time I had done a bit of shopping. Will definitely use again"
The product and service from [REDACTED] was perfect however the garage experience was not. Their customer service is poor.
Ordering is simple. Prices are competitive. Fitting is completed on time.
"bad experience with booking being cancelled at 4.30 the day before, i went to the garage any way and the tyre was there and fitted promptly."
"Stress free and simple process. simple process. Chose my tyres, chose my garage, chose my time, turned up, all of my tyres were there ready and were fitted in less than an hour. Incredibly stress free experience and a great price too. Highly recommended."
My fitting date kept changing and then the garage didn't know I was coming so I had to go back home and return an hour later.
"It was such an efficient service, easy to find a local garage who looked after me very well"
The date i booked was cancelled due to tyres not delivered then it took me various phone calls and no response until i booked a time directly with the fitters
1) Easy to order. 2) Carmarthen Tyre Services service was excellent. Booked time and it went like clockwork
The tyres were not delivered to the garage when we got there so after speaking to customer services they apologised and offered 10% discount and we had to book the car in for another day but 2 weeks has passed and still no refund.
Great price. Easy to arrange and no problems at ATS who were great.
"This is an excellent service, very easy to use website, secure payment options such as PayPal, good selection of tyres and plenty of options for fitting tyres at local garages. Quick easy to use and very price competitive.. Recommended"
I book a time through [REDACTED] and when I get to the fitting centre they don’t have the time available
Simple ordering with wide range of tyres at competitive prices. Easy booking and fitting process.
Got decent tyres at a good price and fitted a garage of choice good experience
good prices appointments and prompt service
Poor afftersales and customer service. Made a complaint never heard a response
Michelin tyre on offer. Super easy booking system. No hassle. Garage literally down the road. Very convenient speedy service. Super
"Original appointment had to be rearranged at request of BC to a date 5 days later. Then for the new appointment arrived at the garage and they initially had no record of the booking, they eventually found it but we had to go away and return an hour and a half later. To top it all off a couple of days before the rearranged appointment I got an email from BC to say that there was a promo of 10% off the very same tyres I had already paid for but not had fitted!"
"Really efficient service. Called me promptly when I had ordered the wrong tyre for my car to give advice and rectify the type of tyre I should have been ordering approved by the manufacturers of my vehicle. Fast fitting, really happy experience."
Superb service. Highly recommend. Offer on a great michelin tyre. Really easy to book online and pay all online which makes it hassle free and the garage is down the road. Convenient and impressive! Thanks
"Customer service is second to none , excellent prices"
Apprehensive at first to use this 'unknown' supplier but worked out really well.[REDACTED] provide the chosen tyre to your chosen fitter usually at a cheaper price than your fitter can provide. They deliver to your chosen fitter and the fitter's profit is from charging [REDACTED] a fitting fee.My experience went really well and I saves significantly on two tyres for my wife's car.
Very helpful didn't have the tyres in stock so gave me better tyres at same price. Thank you [REDACTED]
Fitting garage altered time and ran over by 50 minutes
Worth the money. Very easy to use good communication
Good Service. Have used [REDACTED] a few times. Never had any problems. Prices reasonable. Get them delivered to my local garage for fitting. Always a smooth and hassle free service.
"It's alright, not the best price, had to wait for few extra days until tyres delivered to the garage, also had to wait 2.5 hours in the garage until job done, as they had also replace some part in the car as per usual. Garages just can't let you go without taking extra from you. Good quality tyres supplied. I have decided to go for Michelin Sport 3, I have used cheaper brands before but they didn't lasted long, will see how long these tyres will last."
"Easy to order, great service at the fitting centre - good job - will be using [REDACTED] again"
Used many times now. Always a good price and good service. Fitting garages are also very good.
The garage in Woldingham did a great job fitting the tyres and [REDACTED] offer competitive prices.
"Good price, prompt and efficient servive from fitter."
"Great, quick and easy to navigate the system, lots of choices and fantastic financial options! From start to finish the process was painless!"
Easy to use and able to compare prices quickly and easily
Not cheap
On arrival my standard model vehicle was declared too large to fit [REDACTED] lifting equipment. Wasted my time. Had to take 4 tyres and travel miles to get them fitted at another [REDACTED] partner. I should have been refused or redirected at point of order. The partner was polite hence 2.
Excellent communication throughout as there was a problem with delivering my tyre. Garage were fabulous too.
Never had any problems with my order or the delivery and fitting. Prices are reasonable.
Cheapest tyres around with local fitting.What more can you want?
Best price. Great service to fit. In and out in 10 minutes
Easy access - good price - easy to book.
New tyres on wire wheels. All went smoothly and the wheels On my car are wires and I had to take them back for rebalancing this morning and there was no problem in redoing them and no quibbles eitherVery happy now and recommend this branch
Great value and choice of local fitters.
"Great site, easy to use, good prices"
A good service no time to waste done by bathwick very professional
The services was easy to use from start to finish and the tyres were fitted at exactly the time requested. Very easy and pleasant experience.
Very reliable and prices are very good
Straight forward and great value
"good price, local garage and good service"
Super price and service
"All as it should be. Tyres fitted on time , excellent service"
The selected garage (ats Dundee) marked the alloys around the bolt holes and refused to fix. Done a pre-job walk around with tick sheet and they changed it after the job was carried out. Unprofessional and unhelpful
The process from start to finish was excellent and easy to use. The garage that completed the fitting were also excellent.
good transaction. Easy to use website and really good service from chosen fitting centre
Easy to use website competative prices. Range of installation venues with opening times and addresses. Very convenient and reliable. I always use [REDACTED] for new tyres.
Good prices and easy transaction. Good price. Smooth transaction. Garage was good too.
"Great job from a very friendly fitter. Fantastic service, in & out within 25 mins. 😁"
Good price with quick and convenient service.
Great price Great service Thanks
Great service no issues. We used the mobile fitting service and it was great.
"Ease of ordering,local tyre stockists"
"Excellent service, competitive pricing."
"Simple, straight forward and easy to pick what you want for your budget."
Fab customer service
it was perfect - everything selected and paid online + the tyre exchange was fast and perfectly in time!!
Good for the money and with an amazing people to fit it highly recommend you and the place again
"Good tyre selection, great price easy service."
Great service and price
vast choice of tyres for every budget . Many available times from Local garages to take your vehicle to.
Good Choice at reasonable prices
Happened when it was supposed to and Dreadnought garage were extremely helpful.
"Quick, easy, great prices and at a time that suits."
Good price and simple to book a suitable time and place for fitting
Looked online and found [REDACTED] has very competitive pricing so booked the fitting. It was nice to be able to choose the garage to get the job done and I picked the [REDACTED] Pitstop next to Tesco. They were ready and waiting when I turned up so I left them to it and went and done the weekly shop. Just as I was paying for my shopping I had a call to say all 4 tyres had been changed and the car was ready for collection. I found the whole experience very convenient and it couldn't have gone smoother.
Reasonably priced tyres and easy online booking.
Local Kingsway Garage used helpful. Choice of am or pm but had not realised 8:30 time given was intended as an appointment slot.Did front wheel tracking as well and paid separately as advised. happy to use again.
highly recommended. excellent service and accommodating re collection and delivery too
Very easy to order and book a time slot for fitment.Kept informed about the order at all times.Very good service from the garage.Excellent.
"Prompt and efficient service. Great choice of tyre options, priced very competitively. Effortless purchase and fitting."
"Easy to order, good price and choice of fitting locations"
Would never use [REDACTED] again. Not at all impressed with the service. After making an initial on line purchase and choosing an appropriate time for fitting all seemed well. A couple of days later I was informed that the tyres were not available for delivery in time for the allocated time at the garage.I chose an alternate fitting time for 9:30am the following week. When I arrived at the garage they informed me that the time allotted was at 11am. When I showed the staff my allocated time they informed me that they had declined the time slot and [REDACTED] should have notified me.Had I not needed the replacement tyres fitting immediately for a planned trip to France I would have cancelled on looked elsewhere.The service was appalling.
Best price and convenient. Cheapest priced yet still reasonable brand for truck tyres.Delivered to a conveniently located garage within 48 hours.
"First Rate. Great choice, great prices and an excellent local fitter"
Would certainly my use them again. Very easy to use from Start to finish. Very helpful telephone operator when I had to change tyre fitting slot as ats couldn’t do it the day I first picked.
One cannot guarantee the age of Tyre. we had from December 18 . The receptionist at Tyre center should not decide weather you are given the free wheel alignment check?
Poor quality tyre fitting. Scratches to alloy wheels. Inconsistent pressure applied to tyres.
Website was very easy to use and the prices can not be beaten. Fast delivery and the fitting could not have been easier to arrange
Had to wait 3 hours at the garage. They prioritised customers that had smaller jobs over mine even if the customer comes after me.
"Poor. Ordered 2 x Tyres to be fitted locally, money debited from my account immediately. The following day I check in with BC to be told that they can't actually fit my tyres for when I have booked (and paid) for. Advised to call them to arrange a later date, which is not possible for me. Call the number to arrange having my money refunded but it's a very drawn out experience. Staff on the other end of the phone, however, are very helpful. Have booked elsewhere which is marginally more expensive, but would have saved me hours of messing around and not left me out of pocket while they hang on to my money."
A couple of points deducted due to your having to re-arrange a fitting date (a week later than originally set) following failure of delivery of tyres

"Huge product range, great prices, very good service. What more do you want? And the fitting service from Direct Tyres in Stockport was brilliant. Will definitely use again. Ian Casson"
Ok service overall and good customer service from contact centre advisor. However poor customer journey because I was allowed to pick a date for fitting and then told next day this wasn’t available and then took 3/4 days to finally get a date for fitting. Tried to arrange this through email with agent but response was very slow and ended up having to call and arrange new appointment
"I got a set of Michelin's for a BMW M3 (e46).... and i was really impressed with, firstly the price and equally so how well they perform in the wet.....this is the 2nd full set ive purchased through [REDACTED], but it won't be the last.Great cost and had them fitted at my local ATS garage (South Shields branch), who are always polite, professional and knowledgeable.[REDACTED].com highly recommended by www.irongatelocksmiths. co. uk"
Brilliant experience from start to finish. Easy to order and the garage were superb!

Very quick. Very easy. Cheapest price around.
EXCELLENT SERVICE NO PROBLEMS AT ALL WELL SATISFIED FIRST CLASS TYRES
Excellent service and price !!!
"Bang on. Very quick, very courteous service. I was late (got delayed through Dartford tunnel) and was politely informed that if the work took longer than what was left of my slot I'd have to come back another day to make way for the next customer when they arrived in time. Didn't need to in the end but thought that was a really well positioned communication that showed how they were serious about ensuring everyone got good service."
Fantastic service fantastic price and best of all local garage
Amazing service and the garage used were once again top drawer.
"Very easy to deal with, tyres delivered to selected fitter next day. Overall very satisfied"

Having bought the tyres I was the following day offered a 10% discount.
It was easy and straight forward. The guy that fixed my four tyres was very detailed and thorough. Overall transaction and service was superb. Thank you.
"Easy to organise , delivered next day . Value for money . Couldn’t ask for better service ."
"[REDACTED] I found a very good efficient service. [REDACTED] I found a very good company, The Michelin tyres that I choose were cheaper than any other site I looked at. Choosing a garage to fit the tyres, Everything was carried out efficiently."
I chose six because you didn’t manage to get the tyre to the garage on the day I first arranged had to book another time and date
Mechanic at ats Morley leeds was a complete a***hole to my wife and took 2 and a half hours to fit 4 tyres what a joke.
"Couldn't find a cheaper price, also fitting centre very good."
My original booking time was declined by the garage and I had an email exchange to reschedule which wasn’t a problem. The issue was that the agreed booking wasn’t made because the email wasn’t picked up as BC was busy and had a backlog. This meant I turned up to the garage and wasn’t booked in. Then had to scramble to get it rebooked in before my cars MOT with a bank holiday in the middle. Ended up having to get the tyres replaced on my birthday. Not any real apology from BC and no discount offered for the inconvenience
"Easy booking, competitive prices"
Great website very easy to use and quick delivery to the tyre fitters of my choice who did a great job.
Easy to shop and the fitting was first class
"Two weeks later and the tyres havent arrived! I showed up for a fitting, despite [REDACTED] knowing the tyres weren't there, they still let me show up. Not a phone call. Tried to arrange fitting at another location. They refused. Agreed to go out of my way to get them fitted at the origional fitter - was told no availabillity. Agreed to have them fitted myself, if they deliver to the billing address. Was lied to and told 3-5 days. One of the 4 original tyres is damaged and so its unsafe to continue driving, so i've rented a car for the 3-5 days. Despite knowing this. Communication is lacking. Tyres haven't arrived 2 weeks after ordering. Emails aren't being replied to. Terrible customer service. Havent been refunded yet on the installation costs which weren't provided. Can't get my head around how poor the buying experience has been. I'm very close to just calling into a local garage and getting a different set of tyres to what i wanted, and then doing a charge back because customer support don't seem to care about delivering the product or any support."
Simple and convenient process of making tyre selection at discount price and arranging at local tyre fitting garage.

"A delay in you not being able to get the tyres. 3 out of 4 of my wheels scratched by the fitter. My wheels had been diy sprayed approx 4 weeks earlier. However, I didn't expect two of the three scratched wheels to get approx 8 inch scratches on them."
"Excellent service highly recommended. Ordered my tyres online, turned up to my allocated time slot two days later and all four tyres were fitted within the hour. Easy as pie, absolutely brilliant. Will be using again in the future for certain. Thanks to the Silverburn team."
Great and prompt service.I ordered tyres to be at my local garage for MOT.They arrived by time stated so it was a quick turnaround to get my car back on the road.Will recommend to family and friends

"Marvellous experience. There was a vast array of tyres to choose from depending on the fuel efficiency, weather tolerance and prices and make as well. This was my second time of dealing with [REDACTED] though. Then on the day the tyres were fixed, everything went swooningly well. No complaints at all. Would definitely deal with them again. Recommended to my friends already. So there you have it."
"Have now used [REDACTED] 3 times very easy to book great price local garages, cant recommend enough"

Excellent value
An excellent service provided by both [REDACTED] and Sandhurst Mot who fitted my new tyres. A good service at a reasonable price.
Everything was as expected and could choose a decent garage to fit them
"On booking with [REDACTED] I chose ATS Runcorn as the fitting centre. They proceeded to butcher my car breaking front and rear suspension parts, left my carpet and interior with filthy marks all over them, told me they didn’t care and didn’t carry out the wheel alignment I asked for but told me they had. When I dared to complain I was threatened by the manager. Should I continue?"
Had my tyre fitted at Burnside motors in Carnoustie. Also fitted a new valve on the other tyre for free. Very happy with the service and will definitely be back.
"[REDACTED] is very easy to use. Excellent prices.Good choice of garages. Only problem was the garage which I picked, Motor Techs Essex, had very poor signage and was difficult to find. There was no indication that I was in the correct place. Absolute chaos and no parking available outside garage. That said, the job was completed quickly."
"I have used you guys for over 20 years, but the garage (JW Morris) was not expecting me on the day of the agreed fitting (even though you guys have sent them and me a confirmation email). Not good!"
"Good price, and had the special tyres i wanted.The service at tyre fitting was great also."
No problems. Good prices and choice.
"Because apart from price it wasn't a great experience. I booked and paid choosing my appointment date using your booking process, I was then rang and advised that slot wasn't available, so why did it let me? I was offered appointments days later until I complained and was offered 1 a day later than first booked at another (same chain KAM) at 10.30hrs. on the day I received a text saying appointment was at 0900hrs!. KAM confirmed it was 10:30hrs. When I arrived it was queried whether I was leaving the vehicle, I declined because there is nothing around this KAM garage. I waited and it was completed"
"Service good and job was finished before I realised. Easy to book and TopCashback, too! Will use again next time, I hope."
Everything was very straightforward. No issues. Tyres ready and waiting at my selected garage.
Price and ease
It would have been higher but you no longer have a mobile fitter in my area
Whole tyre changing process from order to fitting was perfect.
If you know what you want its cheaper and more efficient than driving into a garage.
This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] and the service and prices are second to none.

Good to be able to see availability and location plus reviews of products

Pricing and variety.
Easy to navigate the web site. Competitive price and ATS were superb when it came to fitting the tyres
Hassle free & good service/price
"Service was poor on arrival to the fitting centre. Wheel alignment had been carried out prior to my visit (by the same centre) and my steering wheel came 20 degrees off centre, so I will need to carry out another alignment at my cost (Obviously at another centre). staff were useless and at times rude. They also told blatant lies to another customer in front of me. I will not be using the service again as It is the only centre near to me and I absolutely refuse to return there."
Great choice of tyres. Fast efficient service. Reasonable prices.
"Just needed tyres changing, but yet after not ticking any other boxes to have tracking and fluids checked and topped up. ATS still done them. Not impressed"

"Polite, friendly & efficient service"
"Good price, tyres delivered straight to garage and fitted at my convenience."
"Great but. All great, except they can’t be more exact than am or pm for mobile fitting. Would have expected a text the day before giving a narrower window."
Excellent service highly recommended. I have used [REDACTED] twice and found them very reliable. I have had delivery to my home and also used the delivery to garage with fitting option . On both occasions I was very happy with the service. I would highly recommend them and be happy to use again
Great price and efficient service. What's not to like?
"Great value service. Great value, tyres delivered and fitted when convenient for me."
I have used [REDACTED] for a few years now. Over the past few visits I’ve been a little disappointed that the tyres I’ve selected haven’t been ready on time and a new date has always needed to be selected. Fortunately on both occasions I’ve managed to accommodate. However. That’s not always going to be the case and as such I need [REDACTED] to improve on delivering to my chosen garage.
Super easy and the cheapest I could find
"Good price good service. One tyre lost pressure after fitting, I took it to the garage who supplied the fitting service at my home address and they sorted it out no problem. Only issues was it seemed impossible to speak to a human when I needed some aftersales support."
"A Happy Customer. Second time I have used [REDACTED]. Again this was a seamless experience from ordering, choosing a fitting location, scheduling a time and the fitting itself. Happy Customer"
Great price for a great product

Easy to use and a great price.
selected appointment changed. Although i do not have a problem with [REDACTED] 'per se' I did select a time and place specifically to fit the tyres and it was changed with little consultation to a different time unsuitable for me. I have to say when i contacted BC the issue was quickly resolved and an appointment booked elsewhere. So for this i have to mark them down.
Competitive prices and the garage was excellent.
Easy to order. Drove in. Technician met me outside and got straight on with it. Brilliant.
"Good price, good service"
They are more competitive than most but disappointed that the wrong tyres were sent and I had to return to the garage a second time and the promised compensation never materialised.Ian Bailey
Convenient ordering and booking. Ordering and booking couldn't be easier. So very convenient. The whole process was quick and simple.

"It was a good and quick service but. Tbh, it was a good and quick service but I did have to change another tyre whilst I was at the approved garage which actually turned out to be a little cheaper.

Price and efficiency
Bought tyre on line and arranged fitting Excellent quick service Thankyou
"2 new tyres and a lot of waiting around. The purchase and arrangement of 2 new tyres for fitting at a convenient local garage was good. The price was a noticeable saving, and the pre-arranged fitting time meant I was expected at the garage reception. So far so good, with full marks to [REDACTED] at this point. My question from this point on is: how come it took the garage over an hour and a quarter to actually fit the tyres ? Ok, they were diligent enough to check all the wheels before they started, and reported unusual tyre wear on the fronts - for which we agreed to check the alignment. But the alignment check and adjustment was only carried out after the aforementioned 1.25hrs, and trhe end result was a 2 hour visit. For 2 tyres. On a prearranged 1/2 hr slot. With 5 days notice. This to me is unacceptable - some people also have jobs to go to, and I wasn't anticipating this chunk of time taken out of my working day.If Red Bull's F1 team can do it in 1.88 seconds with half a lap's notice , how come a major national chain can be as slovenly as this ? Not impressed. I will use [REDACTED] again, but not, to name names, ATS. (who originally wanted £26 more for exactly the same 2 tyres if bought via their own website)."
"Number 1 for Tyres. This is the place to purchase your tyres. Easy to use, by far the cheapest place on the market with lots of garages to use."
Rob the manager and Andy excellent to deal with. Pleasant and professional
great service and very easy to organise
"Easy to use, competitive range of tyres to choose from and delivered swiftly to a garage of our choice for fitting at an agreed time."
"A very good service, the lads turned up on time and all tyres changed with no issues."
Best value for premium tyres
Easy to purchase and fit. Easy to purchase. Good website with a wide selection of tyres. With info on relevant tyre for your vehicle.Reasonable value for money. Able to book a fitting slot. Correct tyre fitted. Mobile fitter was excellent.
"Excellent prices. Easy to use website, excellent prices and local fitting garage too."
It's okay but you Can improve delivery date when you promise date delivered same date ???
Great tyre prices but terrible garage suggestions.
"Great system, service and value for money. I sue them again and again."
Happy with the price and service received.
Impeccable service with great range of tyres at reasonable prices with special offers.
Used before very prompt and fair prices

Competitive prices Local fitters Good service
Good price on tyres saved £76. Good delivery.
"Straightforward easy process, competitive prices."
"Best prices, easy to use and always spot on"
"Although eventual outcome was OK, there were problems with identifying a suitable fitting garage, I was first told that my choice from the online list was already booked for the day and time selected, and I was offered a less convenient alternative. I said that I would prefer another day at my original choice and was then told that garage could not fit the tyres I needed as it did not have the relevant equipment. I had the sense that there was really no option as to where fitting took place."
"My prefferd garage doesn`t accept [REDACTED] fittings over a weekend so my wife had to take it during the week, not a massive drama obviously but if they wish to be a [REDACTED] fitment centre shouldn`t they accept weekend appointments?"
Tyres fitters let me down as tyre encountered 35 to 20 bar pressure drop whilst getting keys. Upon notifying them they didnt think anything of it and it dropped to flat at home and I had no spare rim tyre. Had to drive flat on new tyres and a crack was in the alloy . The pressure drop had it been noticed would have saved me great misery. Other than that the rest was a good experience.
"Booked fitting many days ahead and got confirmation through that everything was in place, even up to the morning of the fitting. So sorted work around the appointment only to then get a text and an email saying there would be a delay of 5 days when I could have the tyres I ordered fitted. This is not the first time I have been let down by [REDACTED] deliveries!"
All round great service. Best price around. Great range. Can’t say anymore than that.
Great choice of tyres and good price. Only slight criticism is the fitting company said they could have sourced the same tyres for the same price so not a bargain but very convenient.
Local garage Great service Cheaper tyres
Fast friendly service
Great price and the overall experience. Really can recommend. My first purchase and gives you a choice of garages were to have the tyres fitted.
No issue with getting the tyres I require and a quick and easy payment.
Great price and very simple website / booking system.
It's very simple and easy just what you want when buying tyres
This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] and although it seams straight forward I have had problems both times this time around it was a communication error between them and the mobile garage I used (I booked a PM slot but it appears they requested am from the garage) all solved but 30 min on the phone I would rather not of had
Tyre not delivered despite getting notification that it had. Customer service quite slow
I would have given 9 but I had my appointment slot cancelled for a week
Price and ease of buying process
"Couldnt be easier.Prices are competitive, everything is arranged ahead of time - all you have to do is turn up with your car.Great service at chosen garage - no issues."

"Quick, easy, good prices what’s not to like."
Exellent service great price much cheaper than anywhere else and a bonus of having them fitted close by.
Great value easy fast service the only way to get tyres not going to even look elsewhere in future
"Easily to order, price was reasonable, and the garage was quick and did a great job."
Much cheaper than garages direct.
"The service worked well i had four tyres fitted by my local fitter, .by using [REDACTED] it saved me £150 on the price my local fitter would have charged. Coincidently it was the same place that would have been £150 more expensive. My local fitter was also a similar price to a number of other local tyre fitters"
"Great variety of tires, easy to purchase and very convenient. A brilliant service as always!"
Excellent service and good price
[REDACTED] should be your first stop when buying tyres. I find [REDACTED] are very competitive on price with a good range of tyres and a very easy ordering process.I have used them for years now.
Great price and excellent service
Efficient and great prices
"Easy to use website and prompt delivery of tyre,and follow up e.mail."
I was very impressed with the service by [REDACTED] and also such a good price. My tyres were fitted locally with everything being organised very well.
[REDACTED] were exemplary in there service and I would highly recommend them.
Appointment postponed. Incompetent fitting service failed to complete tyre balancing as ordered
"Pricing is excellent, service from the fitters has been great - but both times I've used [REDACTED] the tyres have been delayed and I've had to re-schedule fitting dates"
Cost and location
"I and family members have used [REDACTED] tyres in Handforth Dean now a few times. Their service is outstanding, friendly, courteous and professional. Something which unfortunately is very rare these days. I would without doubt recommend their service to anyone."
"Good price and selection of tyres, have used [REDACTED] a few times know"
Efficient and good price. Direct Tyres and Exhause fitting service were excellent .
Easy to use website and good prices.Let down by appointment system. Told by email it was first come first served on a morning booking. I checked the garage website and it said open at 8.30. Went early to be told I had a 10.00 appointment. When I got home there was a message telling me the same that arrived after I left. Garage was rude.
Good value and quick
Very user friendly site. Tyre prices with discount code excellent! Easy booking and fitting service at a garage and time that suits. Have used [REDACTED] for 8 years 10/10
Great Service. Very pleased with the service and the price.
Great customer service as always
"First class service, easy to use and great price"
would recommend. Good value and garage close by and very helpful
Got a choice of tyres at a good price and got people I know to fit them. Brilliant organisation. Very impressed. Have used them twice now and highly recommend them.
Easy to arrange and saved me a considerable amount per tyre compared to my usual garage. I will be using this service again.
[REDACTED] tyres. [REDACTED] is easy to use prices and choice are excellent fitting centres know their stuff would definitely recommend
"Trouble free user friendly. Very user friendly and a trouble free experience, the tyre fitters were also first class and competent, A1 allround"
No problem from ordering to the fittinggood service. No problem from ordering to the fitting of the tyres staff at garage were polite and helpful
Booking the appointment was very easy and upon arrival everything was in place for an immediate start. The technician was welcoming and answered questions in a competent manner.
You had the tyres I wanted at a competitive price and were able to have them fitted somewhere I trusted at relatively short notice. Very pleased.
Easy to book and exactly what I booked happened..
you use excellent garages coupled with good tyre prices

Excellent service and really friendly and pleasant staff at the depot.
Great price and very efficient service all round
Easy to use great prices and fitting centres great range of tyres would definitely recommend
Great service from local garage and good value.
Very easy to use the online platform and book a slot to get tyres fitted. The garage was very busy that day and I was not able to get the tyres fitted whilst I waited as there was only one member of staff working. I picked the car up later and all was fine.
[REDACTED] was brilliant. The garage I chose from your list wasn't the best decision I have made.
"Its a nobrainer. Great service and the tyres come to me saving my petrol, a bit of a no-brainier really!"
"Service good but refused cash back payment via Quidco. I was happy with service and products, but they refused Quidco cash back claim."
"Brilliant service, no hidden charges. Everything so easy from ordering online to getting the tyres fitted."
Had five tyres fitted to alloy wheels. Had five tyres fitted to a set of brand new wheels. On two of them the balance weights had fallen off by the time I got them home. A phone call to the depot and arrangements were made for this to be rectified on my return. The weights have stayed firm ever since.
"Very good and quick service. My only issue is that once the tyres had been done and I went to drive home in the evening the same day, my car advised me that the 2 tyres that were replaced were too low in pressure and had to drive to garage to pump these up. Apart from that, service was good."
Very pleased....thought i was going to end up with some cheap budget tyres but got good quality ones £14 cheaper than the garage was advertising by going through [REDACTED]...had 4 fitted so saved £56 !
"If you need pricey tyres then you have to check these guys out. Let’s face it, if you are searching on line for tyre prices, then you probably need quite pricey tyres. [REDACTED] had the best prices by a country mile, and I properly shopped around. The garage options for fitting were huge. Will definitely use again."
I had a bad experience with the fitting centre who damaged my wheels but they helped resolve the issue without any fuss.
Was great service and staff were really professional and friendly.
Very professional and extremely good price
"Easy and simple to use. Easy, simple to use, had no issues, couldn't ask for much more really."
"Was recommended by a neighbour and will never look back! I am already recommending to friends and family and by using this site I saved £80 to what the dealer quoted me and so much easier than ringing round explaining to garages that my car has run flats. Awesome site, choose a tyre to suit you fitted at a garage of your choice...what more do you need?!?!"
"Super quick tyre change, guy was really pleasant and chatty. Ideal for changing your tyres quickly before work!"
Great service at a good price
Was really easy and straight forward prices. From purchasing the right tues to picking a garage to fit them that was convenient for me to get to
"Fast , efficient good value"
Used [REDACTED] many times now and I always get a great service. Very competitive costs to boot.
Great service with no problems fantastic prices

"Competitive pricing, quick efficient service, choice of near to home fitting locations, recommendations for specific vehicle types. All round good service."
Efficient service and good value for money.
Tyres. Excellent service no waiting around
Quick easy and a local garage. Good price too.
Really easy to set up and you choose convenient garage and more importantly the time. Good hassle free service and choise of tyre price.
"Great value so simple to use. Easy to use, great selection of tyres plus excellent value. Multiple choice for local fitting..."
"Price was good, service at garage lacking"
A variety of tyre choices to suit my budget and to ensure the safety of my tyres in the wet
"1 of the tyres was an old tyre. I have bought the following 4 Michellin tyres from you.I have called you on the day I was about to buy them to make sure your are not going to sell me old tyres.Today I had the tyres fitted in my local tyreland.To my surprise, when I inspected the tyres and 1 of them was 2218 (a year old tyre), whereas the rest were correctly 2219 (this year's tyres).I am extremely disappointed and I would like a refund for the 1 old tyre you sold me.Also, I tried calling you several times this morning, as according to your opening hoursyou should reply but there was an automated message saying you are closed(on a Thursday 10am)Opening hoursThe [REDACTED].com office hours are:Monday to Friday - 09:00 to 17:30Saturday - 09:00 to 15:00Sunday - Closed"
First class service from ordering to fitting wii definitely use again
"Ordered two tyres, paid for next day delivery. 5 days later, still no tyres and customer service said that they cannot update me as the delivery driver is not in today. I have not been able to drive my car for 4 days as I have been waiting for my new tyres. Disgusting service and treatment. This is the first and last time that I will be using [REDACTED]. I will be sharing this awful experience on Social Media and with friends, family and colleagues.UPDATE: [REDACTED] managed to resolve this issue for me so have changed from 1 star to 3 stars."
"Great price, the fitting was less smooth"
Effortless purchase and installation. Perfect.
Fast and efficient with a payment plan
"Excellent price and service, would recommend A++++"
"Best price , easy to use web page !"
Great service which is very good value for money
"When I arrived at the garage for fitting, the person there said that it was on the diary but that the order details had not been sent to the garage by [REDACTED]. I had to find the email from [REDACTED] on my phone to get the order reference number."
"Very poor service. Appointments were cancelled twice, with minimal notice."
The overall experience was good . The only negative was that the valves were not replaced
"Price, convenience, clarity of using website."
How good your staff is. Your staff were very helpful and phone me back when I made a mistake in my order 👍
Was told by garage two tyres where delivered separately leading to confusion
1 the service was good. 2 the price I'd good
"Fitting had to be reorganised many times as lack of communication between fitter, courier and [REDACTED]."
Messed about with the fitting time ended up having to take half a days holiday to get the tyres fitted
"Nothing wrong with the tyre or price but the fitting centre service was terrible, wont be using them again"
"Happy with my new Avon tyres. I took my two Nissan wheels to ATS Euromaster, Banbury, to have the two [REDACTED] purchased Avon ZV7 185/55 R16 V (83) tyres fitted.I arrived at the due time and ATS promptly fitted and balanced the new tyres on the wheels. I then took the two wheels home and fitted them to my Nissan, I then took the car for a gentle trial run to bed-in the tyres and to wear away the last remnants of paper label still adhering to the tread of one tyre. The tyres look and feel of top quality and the car rides very securely in the wet and dry conditions.The tyres were a good price and I am a happy customer."
"Great service all round. Great price for four tyres, fitted, and swift service by the garage on the day, can’t be faulted."
Delivery was late but I was kept aware of the situation throughout.
Garage did not pump the tyres to recommend pressure
Easy and quick and very reasonably priced
Cheap & convenient
"I had no email to confirm when the booking was and had to chase the garage. Dev at the garage didn't return my call and had to call twice and as a manager he had no people skills and dry as a bone. They had the car for around 2 hours and didn't have my number to ask where the locking key was, which was in an obvious place in a toolbox by the spare wheel!."
"Easy to book, good price, I turned up everything was there ready and all fitted in good time, no problems will use again"
Nearly 2hours after my allotted time.
Very happy with service got a good deal. Paid on line so as soon as Garage located order no more bureaucracy they just got on with it. Was pleasantly surprised with politness and professional manner of the garage Bathwick Tyres Weymouth. I was an out of towner on my hols they treated me kike a regular customer. Excellent service. I dont think they even know how good they are. I have had some interesting service in my time.
Kept waiting although I had a first appointment in the morning.
Poor ditting service
Dealing with [REDACTED] was good but I was after all weather tyres and it could have been slightly easier to search only for them. The readon I have given a low score was my experience with the Tyre fitting company F1 Sheffield - I would not use them again. I gave you a higher score if 9 but the survey did not allow me to share my experience with F1.
"Easy, buy online then pick most convenient place for fitting. Appointment was on time and staff very friendly"
Cheaper at the garage who fitted them Through [REDACTED] when I asked for a price afterwards. Could have saved £27
Very good service from ATS at Plympton just a pity I had to wait 20 minutes past the appointment time for the tyre to be fitted
they fitted the wrong tyre
Fantastic prompt service by 2 efficient technicians. They made us aware of an issue on tyre size and explained thoroughly and reassuringly before proceeding. Would highly recommend.
"Tyres. Cost effective, good service and fast."
Top notch service that saved me a lot of money
Your pricing and Stanfield Garage were great.
"Good selection, good prices and usually in stock. The Stevenage Tyre Center provides an excellent service. What more could you want."
Good local garage and price
"I’ve used BCs for a few years now and have never been let down or messed about. Good selection of tires, good prices and no problems with stock. I use the Stevenage Tyre Centre and they provide an excellent service every time."
Price and choice of tyre. Good sheeting of garages to do the fit Hassle free
Good value. Convenient.
Great service and price. There was a delay but all sorted without a fuss.
Excellent prices for quality brand tyres. Although It would be nice if you could choose a fitting time rather than just the am pm option.
It was so easy to use select your tyres you want select where you want them fitted and when I went to ATS turned up to have them fitted had first class service what more could you ask for..
Great prices and excellent service from[REDACTED] and Collison Motors. Great prices and excellent service from the local garage

Great choice of tyres to choose from for any budget
Good price and choice. easy to use.
Initially the wrong tyres were sent for my vehicle (non run flats). Poor customer service in the follow up. After having the second set of tyres fitted at ATS one of the tyres lost pressure (causing an alarm. ATS attended to the fault but still have an issue. We are having to take the car back to ATS (4th visit) to get it rectified.
Seems good value
Good value and convenient local fitters
"Best prices, easy to use."
Fantastic Service and competitive pricing
Great service. Fast delivery.
Fitting was spot on car much better with set new tyres
Thank you. It’s not the first time I’ve used [REDACTED] and it won’t be the last. The prices are amazing and the amount of locations available is great too. The service was great at Bletchley and in a prime location too.
An excellent package. The price of the tyres including the fitting was competitive. Also the tyre firm that you recommended were very efficient and pleasant to deal with.
[REDACTED] were amazing but fitting garage terrible. [REDACTED] were amazing ordered paid and garages recommended. The recommended garage on the other hand were terrible poor customer service poor communication would never use garage again. Had to attend 2 other garages to have tyres changed not great.
Excellent service a Smithy garage
Excellent product and service. Very competitively priced.
"I Have used [REDACTED] twice, I booked & paid for a convenient slot , only to be e-mailed the next day saying it's not available.Bit of a inconvenience , apart from that ok."

"I went to the garage today for my appointment to fit my tyres and they said my appointment was yesterday and that I hadn't shown up! I checked my emails and I was correct my appointment was today, unfortunately they couldn't fit me in to have them fitted today. I even had a text reminding me of it. I don't blame the garage, it was just poor communication on [REDACTED] part. I now have to go in tomorrow to have them fitted.wasted journey today."
"The price was very competitive, the tyre company that you suggested we use was very efficient and friendly. Overall an excellent experience."
Booked the day off work as per agreed fitting date for it to be cancelled late the night before. Lost a holiday day through work which i can't claim back.
Prices are competitive and the option of having figment at home or at work is a huge bonus as it saves time and extra hassle

"Great customer service. The team were great, they pointed out that I had ordered the non manufacturer approved tyres for my particular car, and then switched to the approved tyre which should have been more expensive at no extra cost."
"Very disappointed with the tyres I purchased, fully appreciate [REDACTED] can't refund as I've already travelled a few hundred miles, but a discount on a replacement set as a gesture of good will would've been nice. As a result I won't ever use [REDACTED] again, but on the upside I will be directly using the fitting centre they allocated as they did give me a discount for my trouble."
"I had two tyres replaced on my Honda Accord 1/08/2019, initial quality of service was excellent.Went to use car day after and found nsf tyre flat, inflated tyre and hoping it doesn't go down over night when I have to leave for work at 5am"
Ordering was so easy. Prices competitive. The only issue I had was with the garage that fitted the wrong tyre to start with but that's no reflection on [REDACTED]. Would use again for sure!
"Tyres fitted well but later than originally booked. Tyres fitted effectively and a good job done. Only issue is that I had booked a time slot which had to be put back a couple of days as the garage could not make that appointment, despite it showing as available on the [REDACTED] site."
Unsure at first about buying tyres online but no need to have worried.First class service. Delivered a day early. Exactly as ordered and fitted by local ATS. Saved £80 on two fronts for my BMW.Would definitely use again.
"Originally given fitting date for all 4 tyres in the booking app, then got a phone call telling me it would be two day later, no problem I was able adjust my plans. On the fitting day (friday) recieved a phone call 5 hours after checkin to say only 3 out of 4 tyres were recieved, told by garage it would now be Monday before 4th tyre would be deliverd. This was not the usual service I have had in the passed from [REDACTED] but would certainly use them again if prices are competitive in the tyre market."
"Good Service. A good selection of tyres at competitive prices,also plenty of places to have the tyres fitted."
Good value for money compared to high street garages.Easy to compare prices of other manufacturers and to order on lineNice to be able to choose a garage to do the fittings.
"Good, prompt and helpful guys."
"Price, good to get 10% off when buying four tyres and web site was easy to use"
It’s really easy to wait at home and the tyres are brought to you! Bit of a no brainier really.
Excellent price. Great website. Fitting partner (ATS) excellent
Tyre was a great price and arrived on time
The price was competitive and combined with a great fitter the process was made simple.
"Efficient,fair price and good service.Only fault,no appointment offered with this fitter,except am/pm.So had a little wait.Not a problem for me but others may be a bit put off."
Fantastic service at the right price I will definitely get my tyres from blacksirc. Fantastic service at the right price will definitely get my tyres from [REDACTED] I've paid twice the price in the past and I will definitely pass it on to frends and family thank you and ATS for shorting me out Kev
Easy to use at a fair price.
Excellent customer service and staff were really helpful
Excellent service and price Helpful staff and great communication
"Good price expertly fitted. Always get a good deal with [REDACTED]. Easy to choose, buy and order online. Usually next day or two for fitting. The fitting centres I have used lately have all been good."
very bad experience. fitting day was for Booked for Tuesday and I went down and they would't do it they reschedule for next day making me lose time and money. Also I wanted the rim protection on my tires they delivered the one without. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
Changed two front tyres and a free Winter checks resulted in my vans coolant tank cap being left off then a blown head gasket on a three year old van
Great service at the right price.
"Easy process to buy and have tyres fitted. Selected tyres online, chose garage close to me and a short time later tyres were fitted to my car."
Great fast efficient service from Savoy tyres Grimsby Thanks
Davey to arrange and organise for tyres to be changed
"Quick, easy and a good garage."
I have shopped with [REDACTED] twice now and always get great service and value for money
"No hassle, quick fitting. Never change the tyres the conventional way again"
"Strait forward ,good price and garage I used gave good service would definitely recommend and use [REDACTED] again 👍"
"Booked on the Friday for the following Wed, only to get an E-Mail at 5pm on the Tuesdsy to say they had to arrange another fitting time! Poor service!"
"Superb service! I am very fussy about who I let near my car and was a bit apprehensive buying tyre's online and then getting just any mobile fitter from their network to carry out the work but I would definitely use again. Smart chap, nothing too much trouble services wise and not a scratch or a dirty mark on my perfect wheels when done."
"Brilliant service but only got 4 stars because the garage I picked said it was available when I wanted the tyres fitting but I then got an email saying they couldn't fit them until 4 days after, [REDACTED] quickly found another local garage that could fit them when I wanted them doing and the garage was excellent."
Simple process good price
Cos you didn't send the tyres to the fitting centre and then didn't offer any compensation even though fitting is delayed over a week and you only told me at 5.45pm the night before the fitting day
Fast and value for money service.
"Quick and easy to order, reasonable price"
Fast efficient service. Good tyre fitting partners.
The tyres are good value but the service at my local place (VGS High Wycombe) is abysmal. I have taken the car their twice to have your tyres fitted and both times they were unbearably slow in doing the job and totally lacking in any customer communication ability.
great website and garage used were very good too
2nd time with [REDACTED] a saving of over £75 on each tyre very professional and easy to deal with
"Easy to book an appointment, reasonable price and friendly staff."
Great system and very pleased with result but long wait on an am appointment
"Highly recommended. Well laid out website.everything explained and eady to use. Quality tyres,At the cheapest price I could find.Fitter arrived when he said he would cheerful friendly and both on with the job"
Good price and great service fitting by ATS Trowbridge
Total lack of customer service and care
Very efficient and professional.
"Good tyre's, very good value and the car handles very well"
Service was excellent including the fitting arrangements. Just not quite sure about the quality of the tyres provided.
The whole experience was positive. The tyres were a very good price and the garage very friendly. Will definitely use again.
great service and cheap
Good price and service. Dropped 1 mark because of a slight mix up with the tyre fitting date.
Fabulous prices and service. I always use [REDACTED] for my Tyres. Great prices and great service.
Good selection. Used a few times good selection of tyres. Website can be a bit of a pain sometimes but otherwise great. Always good service. I use mobile fitting and never met the person but job always appears done to a high standard
Website could be easier to use I terms of filtering but good prices and selection
Very efficient service easy to book and get fitted
Service was friendly and very efficient.
"Had an awful experience. The tyres are great goodyears so can't really go wron [REDACTED] need to take more car when selecting garages to fit there tyres. The issues I have is with the garage who fitted the tyres david duthie motors peebles they have chipped, scratched and made gouges round the rims. When I contacted the garage ( David duthie motors ) peebles they said the alloys are corroded they do have small areas of corrosion and not the cause of the damage there are even Mark's on the centre of the wheel where it has been secured to the machine.I have myself been in the automotive trade for over 20 years and in my early days fitting tyres if I had damaged a customers alloys like they have mine I would have offered to repair them without question. I think its ridiculous a so called [REDACTED] authorised installer can treat a customer like this. Safe to say I will never set foot in this garage again i won't be recommending david duthie motors peebles to anyone in fact I'll be telling my family and friends to go elsewhere, due to this experience probably never use [REDACTED] again."
Seen on time and very helpful when there was a problem which was fixed with question.
Yeah was an easy enough experience but wouldn’t be totally sold on the garage I went to
Not impressed with service centre but price and comms were good
"Easy, professional service, reasonably priced."
No tyres on 1st visit and no fitter available on the second visit and when they finally fitted the tyres the fitter was rude to my partner.
"Excellent service, had something on ,on the day of fitting and called the day before and had them fitted within an hour of calling."
No issues with [REDACTED] however staff at McConechy’s very poor customer service
"Fantastic service, great value, precision operation."
Great savings

"New tyre. Easy, efficient and best prices."
Installation date was delayed four times. Ended up being 9 days after original install date given that I got my tyre
"You did not deliver on time as 1st email promised and then sent email late on the Monday saying tyres would be another 2 days for delivery, and being self employed I lost work waiting for my tyres"
It's value for money and my local garage are a partner
Booked for new tyres Saturday morning MOT Monday went to get tyres changed Saturday morning the booking had been changed!! Found an email in spam!! No phone call. Got an advisory on M.O.T won’t be using again!!
Was late. 3 and a half hours but it was due to lack of staff but the fitters did their best.
I have used before and will use againGreat Service. I have used before and will use again when I need tyres . It’s great to order online and then pick where you want them fitted .
"Stress free tyre renewal for novices and experienced car owners. Easy site to navigate and make a clear choice of tyre. It's one of THE most important choices too, cheap tyres are a liability! On this site they're all top makes but with varied characteristics like fuel economy, road noise etc all clearly explained, and on this occasion £30 per tyre less than my local garage.I have recommended [REDACTED].com to anyone who will listen!"
The service and price was exceptional
"Excellent service from to finish, simple process and a great choice at great prices. Able to book when convenient to me, very pleased and would recommend."
"Ease of ordering, good pricing and website very informative"
"I constantly had poor customer service and then when promised with compensation, you even forgot to provide that!"
"I got what I wanted with very few steps, information was clear and concise and chosen garage were prompt and kept the job simple"
Like the business model but it failed first time for me because I was told at 6pm the night before fitting that the tyre had not reached the ATS depot. As that was my only opportunity to have the tyre fitted before an important trip the next week this was a big issue
"Great on time service, no hassle, worry free"
Tyres for every budget book and pay online good selection of garages no messing about

"I have a long history of buying from you, and therefore trusted you with my beloved 35 year old, dream car, a tiny Alfa. She was crunched in every gear the mechanic used. When I drove away the car was backfiring severely because this gibbon had flooded the engine, which has caused reliability issues since."

They called me back. Tyres fitted, all good. They were great. Point being if I’d had left it up to [REDACTED].com protocol I’d have had to wait another 3 days for fitting, rebook, etc. The guys at ATS were just too busy to answer the phone."

Good experience but there is room for improvement. When asking the sales team to match the price found on a different website for the same pair of tyres they couldn't do anything but 2 days later same tyre brand had a multibuy deal.
Because the garage refused to put the two new tyres I bought on the same axle leaving me with a car that was dangerous to drive.

Excellent. Made choosing the right tyres for my budget very simple and straightforward!
Easy to order the tyres you wanted & they arrived at the fitting station. At the fitting station I was pursued to have my tracking adjusted. I had to go back 3 times until they got my steering wheel pointing in the right direction
Cheaper than any other quote and easy arrangements for fitting
Very easy to place my order. Great time slots available. Excellent service from the company that fitted my tyres. The price of tyres and fitting was superb.
"I'm a fairly regular customer and on trying to purchase 2 tyres with 10% off the payable total didn't equate to 10% off so emailed the question and the answer was that the 10% discount was on the tyre, not on the tyre, valve and balance which i thought was an all inclusive price. I'm still a [REDACTED] fan but wish that the information was made clear."
Price wasn’t actually the cheapest but only found out after ordering

"Great service. Came a day earlier than booked but that was fine with me as I had the tyres I purchased from [REDACTED].com ,I've used them twice and never had a problem definitely going to be a regular customer,"
TIMELY AND EFFICIENT SERVICE. Arrived on time and fitted the tyres swiftly and efficiently
"Easy quick. Easy to order,great service at a good price."
Great service at a good price and late opening hours really helped me.
Spot on. Good price. Delivery spot on. Fitting no problems
"I will NEVER be using this thieving company again. They charged me 4 times for 2 tyres, cancelled the order and then only refunded me 3 times. I had to chase them for the refund for a week and a half after just being ignored!!! I was absolutely livid that they could take that much money from my card without my permission. Surely this is fraud??!! I’m just glad I ordered on a credit card and not from my bank or I may have been arguing about over draft charges too which I’m sure they wouldn’t have cared about."
"DO NOT USE. I would give no stars if I could. I don’t like leaving bad reviews but I will NEVER be using this thieving company again. They charged me 4 times for 2 tyres, cancelled the order and then only refunded me 3 times. I had to chase them for the refund for a week and a half after just being ignored!!!

Local fitter and value for money.
Easy to use website. Efficient service. Up to date real time notifications.
Excellent Service. I paid extra to have my tyres changed at home which was worth it as it saved a lot of hassle. Everything was done quickly and on time so I highly recommend [REDACTED].
Prompt delivery to garage and good price
"Easy to order and have delivered straight to fitter - competitive prices, happy with service."
"Straight forward booking process, good choice of local garages. Was able to choose a date that suited."
Finds you the best deal
Easy to buy tyres and reasonably priced.
Efficient easy & competitive prices
Easy to order specific tyres online and to choose a fitting station of your choice.
Great Service and great prices
"Easy, simple to use and great price. Use every time."
You pick you tyres and the date for fitting and then just as usual the next day I get an email saying there is a problem and the date is not available
Really good. Honestly a fantastic experience. The garage (Connors Car Centre in Brentford) were brilliant.
"Nice, and quick...a bit too expensive"
OK on price and convenience but garage wasn't aware I was a BC customer or wanted the free brake and tracking test. Tracking was a little out but I'd had it tested at Halfords not long before so I was slightly suspicious.
Great service at Express tyres
"Good experience and a first class fitting service by Tyre & Exhausts in Lincoln, definitely use both again shortly"
An easy way to buy new tyres and book the fitting with the total cost given up front.
"Process of booking and price was excellent. However, cash back through Quidco has just been declined. Having to raise a claim, which is the reason I've reduced the star rating. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars."
Occasionally other online retailers can be cheaper. Otherwise great prices for the Michelin Pilot Sport 4s saving 10% if buying 2. I can also use the garage I like down the road.
I experienced poor customer service with this purchase
Good price for tyres and easy to order
"Everything was so simple, thought I would have some sort of problem being as I got such a great bargain and a third party fitting, but no it was all great, thank you."
"Great website, unbeatable prices, great fitting!"
Easy to use website with clear pricing.
Very good service even though they were very busy.
Ease of ordering and booking a fitting date. Good prices.
Under impression that prices are cheaper.
"Excellent service, brilliant fitting centre."
"Friendly and professional service, recommended."
"Easy and hassle free. Easy to use website, great range of tyres, excellent price and easy to find a local tyre centre to fit them. All in all easy and hassle free."
The tyres were not delivered to the fitter but no information was given about a problem.
Easy to use and tyre fitted on time on day booked.
Easy to use website and good prices.
"Efficient and prompt but. Efficiently and promptly replaced 3 tyres. But left at 3 widely-differing pressures. This should definitely not happen, hence not a 5-star service."
I was less than impressed with the garage who fitted my tyres
The process to order tyres was easy and included the booking for fitment. The price was much better than the high street too.
"Good value, local fiting"
So much better than the regular tyre/exhaust outlets: you get what you want when you want it at a good price and quality fitting.
Particularly because of the great service from M & S Tyres
"It was easy to compare prices, look at options and book"
"All went to plan. Everything worked perfectly, from selecting the tyres to booking the fitting and the fitting itself. I really appreciated being able to do all the arrangements online and not have to wait at the fitting centre."
Easy ordering process and great choice of product at a competitive prices. Booking fitting locally always goes smoothly and is done quickly and efficiently.
The process was clear and it all went as detailed. The fitting centre was of a good standard.
"The online site worked efficiently, broad choice of tyres and good email response to a query. Everything worked as it was supposed to which is a reassuring aspect to any service!"
Delivery was late and fitting was changed from friday to monday. The email i recieved was a bit vague and the dates were hard to understand. This email was recieved thursday evening when fitting was meant to be friday morning thankfully i had not taken time off work.
Very good service and good price.
"Good prices, convenient, choice of fitting providers, excellent service"
Easy order through [REDACTED] and excellent fitting service from McConechy's
Very easy to use web site. Fitting company very good. a good price.
Nice quick and easy experience. Tyres fitted well no issues at all
"The reason is , I made a mistake about my fitting date and [REDACTED] sorted it out with no problem and my tyres were fitted asap as my needs."
Very impressed with the price and the fact you can get the fitting of the tyres all booked on line.
"Pricing was wide ranging, choice of fitment was wide ranging and a choice of fitting centres!!!!!. What's not to like."
No issue with tyres supplied or the service received but our car had its MOT the following day and the garage found that [REDACTED] had over-tightened the wheel nuts to the point where they had to break them off and fit four new ones at a cost to us. Seeking compensation from [REDACTED] for this unnecessary cost.
Prices were competitive & there was a local fiter
Very easy to use. Choice of local garages.
Excellent service and a good price
Easy and very local service
"the best value for money, the tyre depot is only 250 yards away from where I live and I get great service"
[REDACTED] website was very user-friendly and was the only site that was able to quote me for the unusual size tyres that I needed. They were also great value for money.
Good price nice and easy to book
Tyres sent to local garage competitive prices
Great customer experience and good value for money

Brilliant service from online order to fitment.
"Great value tyres, fitter didn’t use correct pressure though"
Easy purchase online and quick service at the fitting centre
"Motorworx. Tried one garage , wasn't too impressed by length of wait to get two rear tyres changed ,then went to motorworx in anniesland and was really pleased with friendly and efficient service , I will use motorworx again."
Great service and price thank you. Very happy customer
Very professional and reasonable prices
"It is easy and convenient using [REDACTED], and the price is usually cheaper than if you go to a tyre fitting bag."
"After searching locally for a dealer to supply and fit tyres for my MR2, I remembered your site. You were over £300 cheaper."
"Communication a little lacking, had to chase details the day before fitting then received a generic response"
Lots of messing around with the fitting dates.
Best price and great customer service
"Wouldn’t use them again for [REDACTED] order , they tried to push for me to buy wheel alignment which I did not need at all , not very good practice from this store"
"Really good service, fast and reliable! Great price overall"
Good value and excellent website and service!
"Ordered wrong tyres, a quick phone call and the operator couldn’t be more helpful in resolving the issue"
Good tyres shame about the fitting. Good prices and a very wide range of tyres. I have knocked off one star because the fitting place mismatched pressures by 7 psi across the axle I.e. illegal and unsafe. Fortunately I always check pressures myself but suspect many folks would assume it would be OK after a pair of new tyres had been put on.
Very simple and efficient service. Would have given a ten but would have liked to know my exact fitting appointment time initially rather than being given just AM and then not being sure the exact time until later when I received another email with 9am.
"Easy to find the tyres I needed & book the fitting close by , so easy , amazing . 😀"
"The Good Bad. Having used [REDACTED] many times I know how good the service can be, but on this ocassion the first agreed fitting date was was not completed (after I had booked a day off work very inconvenient) when I spoke to your representative who was very obliging finally managed to get a fitting date.Previously I have recommended you to several family and friends who have actually purchased tyres in the past but now I'm not confident in future recommendations."
"second hand tyres do not buy. purchased a set of bridgestone tyres, was looking forward to putting them on a project car, but what I received was some old, dirty tyres with no manufacture markings, if I didn't know any better I'd think they were second hand tyres"
great friendly service. Only thing is the tyre pressure needed checked the next day!
"Excellent service, local fitters."
"Good price on the tyre I wanted, and was able to get local fitting at a convenient time."
Very easy saving me as a pensioner a lot of money
Very helpful and prompt. I ordered the wrong type of tyre instead of Run Flat tyres i orderd the normal tyres. I got back in touch with them and they immediatley rectified the promlem. It was no problem them. I am very pleased
"Friendly guys , fitted quickly and efficently"
"Good choice of tyres, great prices easy to organise and local."
"I thought the site was easy to use, great choice and ratings of products were clear. I addition to this I found the choice of products to be good value for money, especially when you buy 2 and get more money off."
Easy to use website and tyres fitted quickly.
Thanks for the perfect service got the tyres fitted at a centre with professional fitting staff
Efficient service at the garage that I used
Delayed tyre and still charged full price and delivery
Easy to order and prices are fairly competitive.
Good service in the past but now no facility to phone to get advice. The fitter I selected did not give appointments and worked on a first come first served basis. This wasn't a problem as it happens but could have been and I wasn't warned of this prior to placing the order. Also the fitter fitted one tyre incorrectly which I had to get rectified on a second visit
Good service and value.
Very good value for money
Resolved issues with wrong tires sent out v quickly Thanks again Alex
"The range of choice and pricing, both for actual tyres and fitting. The mobile fitter was excellent."
Customer service very poor
"In and out in 20 minutes, great seevice"
"quick, easy and prices was a saving"
excellent price and slick service
Easy to arrange and cheapest quote
Easy to use website the garage we went to was excellent
Bad fitter experience. In fairness the review is based on the fitters ATS who put the tyre on backwards which caused an MOT failure. Thankfully quickly resolved by the MOT garage but extra £20 which negated the [REDACTED] saving.
"Brilliant service, excellent price. Thank you."
"Quick ,efficient and in a location convenient to me despite being 240miles away from home"
Prompt delivery
I chose BC on price but then the service proved to be excellent!
Reasonable price and fast service
Great price and sevice polite staff. Easy online ordering and good communication
Easy to use and book an appointment. Great price!
"Great service, hassle free, great prices.Osbourne motors fitted my tyres another 5 star experience from them."
Flawless experience at a good price
good priced premium brand tyre
"Good price, easy to arrange, good fitter"
Excellent value. Only minor gripe was that the fitting company left wheels very dirty
Ease of ordering. Very competitive pricing and vast amount of local garages available.
Good price and no problems at the chosen garage
"Best prices I found great communication, I made a mistake on the tyres I ordered when I went to local garage for fitting ... 1 phone call all changed to correct types and no extra charge for collecting and re- delivery.. great service will use again.."
Not so much [REDACTED] itself but some of the fitting centres can be a bit poor in terms of service and that is part of the whole process.
Would recommend. Easy-to-use website best prices that you will find and very convenient with a lot of local garages to choose from
"No problems whatsoever, saved £200 on garage quote for genuine Pirelli tyres for the Jag"
I found the whole experience quick professional and competitively priced.
Your recent failure to deliver and initial indifference and incompetence of your customer service
Good value and service.
A quick and easy way to buy tyres at a good price.
"Quick, cheap, reliable service"
"Great prices, and really good service if you choose the right fitting centre."
"Website was easy to use, plenty of choices of tyres and garages to fit them. Appointment at the garage went like clock work."
Good prices and local fitting
"In the past I have had good service, however this last time was not good. My booking was cancelled the day before it was due because my tyres “went missing” I was then offered another booking 2 days later, the day I was traveling to France. I rang your service number a few times to see if my tyres had been found. In the end they turned up 25 minutes before 12 on the Friday. The whole thing was very stressful!"
"Competitive prices. Tyres delivered on time to fitting centre. Unfortunately, the booking for fitting was not registered on their system - I assume this was their responsibility. Fitting time delayed by 1.5 hrs."
"I looked on line for the tyres that I wanted , they had a offer of 10% discount. I ordered them online and 3days later had them fitted at a garage near to where I live."
"Best price available, easy to use site and service from garage was excellent."
Delivery failures which were avoidable. We had to wait over an hour past fitment time and when they’d remove the front tyres they discovered one of the new ones had been damaged in transit so they old tyre had to go back on followed by another 2 day wait. Things like this can happen but it has put me off using this route. Ultimately why wasn’t the tyre checked on delivery and couldn’t we have been told the pre-booked time was unachievable in advance? This two thins would’ve mitigated the sour taste now left.
Good price and reliable and convenient fitting.
"Convenience, would choose a different fitting centre next time though."
"Efficient, Price, Information and Accuracy of Tyres available in order to make a viable choice."
"I love using [REDACTED], its so easy to use and the tyres to compare online are so diverse and broad. I only ever go for the same tyres but its always worth a look at the deals and also the prices of better brands."
"Hi, The fitting of the two front tyres fitted to my car as ordered. But, my computer stated that the tyres where under inflated and the dust caps on the valves were missing.I had to re inflate to the correct pressures.Also, i went back to the fitter who stated that their systems were calibrated.I think that this was a sloppy operation and should not happen on such a mundane task.Sending vehicles out on to the highway in such a maner could end in a tragedy."
Great service and very proactive support
Excellent in every regard. A. Ahmed
"Super, turned up on time when doing mobile fitting. Nice guy and the price overall was cheaper than anywhere else. Will definitely use again."
Great service from the guys at Purley Nr Reading
"So easy, just order tyres then choose from the list of local garages to get them fitted. Excellent service and very reasonable prices."
"Competitive prices, easy to order & arrange fitting at a time that suited me. Perfect."
"Good price, good service."
Great prices and great service
Good prices and more convenient great service
Great Value for Money and a top notch customer services team. I have used [REDACTED] many times and saved lots of money. Last time the ATS Garage I chose to fit my tyres let me down but the [REDACTED] customer service team sorted out everything for me. I won't go back to ATS but I'll always trust [REDACTED].
"Good prices,service and on time, in fact early, Ray your fitter nice bloke very quick and thorough thanks."
Straight forward to organise and use. Local garage which was also helpful
"Amazinglŷ fast, efficient and reasonably priced service. Will certainly use [REDACTED] in future. L. Croll, Alloa, Scotland."
good value
Excellent service and very competitive prices
tyres. Excellent website easy to use. No extra hard sell.
"Good prices , easy access to web site, i was kept informed , everything went smoothly as planned."
Great service great priced tyes and innmy case i only could take the wheel down not car and they changed tyre and balanced them couldnt fault them
happy. very quick. price less or more the same than other nut seems more transparent what you choose you have
Excellent service. Great value for money. Would recommend
"Arrived at McConaughey's to get 2 front tyres fitted at half eight. Place never opened till 8.45 no one greeted me,so I announced my arrival. Staff were sitting about on phones , no one able to switch on computers . Eventually someone offered to fit tyres. Next day got call from them saying they had fitted wrong tyres and could I come back. Went back next day to get tyres swapped, got home and noticed alloys at front damaged. Just back from getting alloys repaired, had to spend my own money to get rear alloys coated same colour. Terrible experience"
Service from [REDACTED] was good but the garage that fitted them damaged an alloy
easy ordering local fitters AWR spot on all in all 10/10 will use again
"Great service great prices and very easy. After using [REDACTED] for the first time about 4 years ago and realising how easy it was to book my car in for replacement tyre, review which tyres I wanted, compare prices, book into my garage of choice and save a lot of money in the process. I won't go back to booking direct into a garage."
Clear communication and ease of managing order. Interest in customer genuine.
Excellent service from quote to fitting
"Easy to order, pick your own timing"
Easy to online to book and choose your garage date and AM/PM slots to suit
Good prices and fitters
Great price. Great service
Very friendly and very helpful and very compatable with prices highly recommend thanks again
"Great service, quick and easy to use and great prices"
Highly recommend and very friendly very compatable prices thanks again
Good customer response.
Tyres. Great service and excellent work in a great time
Wrong tyres sent in the first instance. Replacements did not turn up. Took 2 weeks to get rectified!!!
Great price and fitted on the driveOnly criticism is they never checked the tracking as was requested
Second time I have used this company. Pricing very competitive and has a garage convenient to me
"Simple website with a great choice of tyres, which were delivered directly to a local tyre centre and fitted at a convenient time."
Job was completed with an additional job of a new valve fitted on my other back tyre completely free. Very satisfied and will definitely use again.
"Quality product, fast and efficient service"
Very easy to use and great price.
Cost & availability
Right price and easy to access locally
Excellent service. Great Price!
A very good service at the right price
"The whole experience was pretty painless. The only concern I had was that when I went back for my car, it was unlocked on the forecourt and my keys were left on full view on the counter with no staff in sight. It could very easily have been stolen."
So easy to make my purchase and have my tyres fitted.
Booking is just like Servicing Stop. Its not a guranteed booking which is frustrating despite it showing as available... Waited until the night before to tell me it would be later that weekend and did it last minute so I couldnt ring to discuss. Poor booking facility overall....
The service was excellent. It is the 3rd time I have had tyres from [REDACTED]. I would recommend the service but Not the garage I used.
It is working and worth it.
Great value for money and brilliant service.
Cancelled fitting twice shambles database not up to date with garages who can fit tyres of 21inches.
There was a mix up regarding appointment times
"My experience is limited to 2 purchases from different suppliers. The first about 3 yrs ago from a Subaru garage in Hailey was first class, whereas my recent visit to a supplier in Witney was poor by comparison!"
Good options with reasonable prices
"Very good, other than the last minute change of date, they’re very good. Would get 5 stars if it weren’t for that."
"simple, easy and a very competitive price to get my new tyres fitted"
"Simple to do, good value, everything came together without any fuss."
Easy to order. Good prices and great service.
Best value and easy to book... absolutely no hassle!
Excellent service and prices and thanks to everyone who worked in the team
Best place to shop for tyres. Wide range of local fitting centres. Very easy to purchase online.
Because the garage used to fit my tyres is the same garage I use for all my car maintenance
"Easy to use site, excellent results each and every time I order. Best prices. Have the tyre brand I want for my car (Goodyear), tyre fitters are great too"
first time using [REDACTED] and saved me almost £100
"Great prices, simple efficient service, extensive choice of tyres. This is now my absolute go to source of tyres."

"Really easy process, wide variety of premium tyres."
Quick response and good service
Great service! Have now chamged my local garage to the one [REDACTED] found for me

"Quick, efficient and your premium partner is very good"
Good choice of tyres at reasonable price.
Best Prices Around. I have used [REDACTED].com a number of times and have always found them to best the prices on the internet. They are very convenient to use as they have numerous fitting shops around the country.
Simply the best. I have been replacing my tyres with [REDACTED] for at least 15 year still providing a 5 star service.
Excellent service great price much cheaper than anywhere else and a bonus of having them fitted close by.
No hassle very straightforward and reasonably priced 😊
"So simply and amazing service at the garage, receptionist was brilliant"
"Needed new tyre, the price was great and the whole service was excellent."
Very friendly and helpful staff at Bar Hill Cambridge fitting station. Definitely will recommend to my friends.
Good service but ordered two tyres and only one was delivered to the designated garage. I was kept aware by email of the problems but I tyre fitting was delayed a couple of days.
all went seamlessly and the tyre fitter was excellent highly recommended
Best value around after checking many tyre sites on the web
Customer greeting was 1st class and work carried out within specified time.
I ordered my tyres 2 weeks prior to them being fitted. Only 3 out of 4 turned up at the tyre fitters. I was Disappointed with this service. [REDACTED] tyres are a little cheaper but not sure about delivery standards. However the 4th tyre turned up 40 minutes later. Not good enough service for 1st time customer.
Excellent price and excellent service - thank you!
"Price, ease of ordering"
Do homework in future. Beaten on price by Kwik fit to the tune of £186.68 to £176.40 for 2 Goodyear efficiency grip tyres for my Mondeo but when earlier quoted £25 to do a puncture repair by Kwik fit never thought to check their tyre price which were on special offer. Won't make that mistake again.
"Good prices, seamless delivery to chosen installer, and efficient service."
Great service and hassle free. So easy to use and wide choice of fitting service.
Excellent service. Moreland Garage were brilliant. I would definitely use again.

The tyre was fine but BC mucked up the fitting appointment and the fitters were not expecting me.
"Tyres fitted as ordered, and to time specified"
The service - both from your website and the actual supplier/fitter was excellent.
"Easy, great service, saving money!"

Top Class Customer Service. Very easy to deal with and excellent customer service. Would happily deal with again. Thank you.
"Good and fast service with a great saving. 3rd set of tyres now and would recommend, takes all the hassle away."
"Yes I would recommend [REDACTED], have used the website several times to buy tyres without issues except the latest visit when the wheel nuts were over tightened, the car had an MOT the following day and we had to pay extra for all four wheel nuts to be replaced as the over tightened ones broke when being removed."
"An 8 is a very fair score as this would give room for improvement, not everything was perfect but I think the score down was more based on the unfriendly garage fitting the tyre's"
"Went smoothly, would use again. Only thing was one email gave different time than requested but final text gave correct time."
"Everything worked perfectly, really good to be able to book a fitting slot online."
Easy and good value
"It’s easy, competitive with a considerable choice of tyres. The information regarding tyre types for example fuel consumption, road noise is excellent."

"I had a completely smooth experience, both in the ordering and at Lurgan Tyre Centre."
Fast service. Competitive prices. Will use again.
Easy and good price

"Easy, efficient and good value for money"
Always efficient service and good value
"You provide an easy to follow, cost effective, professional service."
"60 saving compared with local provider. My purchase was for two tyres- I got my quote from [REDACTED], and phoned a local supplier, and by purchasing from [REDACTED].com, I saved £60. Smooth easy transaction. Happy to recommend."
Great value for money and great service
Excellent service and very well priced
The experience for me was very easy as there was a local garage that had already undertaken the vehicle MOT and were going to complete the re-test. Other people may have different circumstances and prefer to shop direct with a garage.
"So easy to do, have a great choice of places to pick."
did not provide the tyres I ordered
no wating I arrived on time and my tyre was fitted on time
Easy to place order. Convenient. Competitive
Website really easy to use & helped me choose the correct tyres for my type of car. Then directed me to the nearest garage where the tyres would be delivered & fitted there
Very good service and price
Good prices. I've never had any issues when I've ordered tyres.
Couldn’t be easier or better value!
"great prices, wide choice of brands, good choice of fitting garages. 5 star service"
Having checked a few options [REDACTED] was the best value. Ordered and fitted without a problem.
great value and service
"great price, great service."
Great tires uniroyal
Fantastic experience all round from ease of use buying the tyres to arranging the appointment at the service centre. All work was carried out to the highest specification
"Easy to use, great pricing and no hassle, what's not to like?"
Because I could have bought my tyres from another similar company for a few pound cheaper but [REDACTED] would not price match.
You delivered what I needed without any hassle
Excellent service and they were exactly the tyres I needed at a very good price
Very easy and hassle free. This is my first time using [REDACTED].com and I'll definitely be using again. It allows a easy comparison against other tire brands (because there are a lot) and effortless to arrange where and when to get the tires fitted. I didn't even need to print any paperwork!
Quick easy and a great experience at the allotted fitment centre
"Great service, quick, good quality products"
Excellent Customer Service
I have used [REDACTED] at least 6 times now. I come back for very good prices and p consistent quickness of fitting at local tyre centre. I would definitely recommend
Great value - big savings with simple servicePerfect
"Very easy from start to finish, good website to order from, easy to choose the tyres and select where to have them fitted. Garage was very professional, work didn’t take that long and the staff were all very friendly and helpful."
Good value for money and convenient
good service. very good tyre
A faultless and most cost efficient process from start to finish
All went smoothly from ordering to fitting with good communication routes
Waiting for a call from yourselves
Easy and cost effective
"An easy way to order tyres, convenient and competitive prices"
"Straight forward service. Two new tyres ordered online and fitted as arranged 3 days later.No problems. Straight forward, easy and efficient.Recommended."
Satidfied. Quick and easy to arrange the purchase and tyre fitting
Always easy to make an informed choice as the tyre information is clear and concise. Fitting outlets are friendly and professional.
"good and friendly service. Friendly staff and place, tyres well fitted and grate service."
when I turned up at ATS EUROMASTER only 3 on the 4 tyres I had order was there. I had to go away and wait to be informed when it would turn up
Used them before. Price and choice is excellent. Appointments mean no hanging around.
The service was simple easy and the choice of tyre was decided on price and I believe was good choice based my selection.
"First class service provided. A first class service was provided. Not only for the delivery a day early the fitting was also completed on the same day. Excellent customer care was provided at the fitting station too. Many, many thanks to all those involved."
No issues with [REDACTED] but garage allocated to fit them was unable to loosen nuts. Had to take them to another garage to be fitted at an extra cost to myself.
Nice and easy and good pricr
Tyres hadn’t arrived at the fitting station. Had to return the following day.
These tyre are really good everybody low noise great on wet improved my steering .am over the moon stay away from winter tires lol
"Quick and simple process, with the ordered tyres ready and available"
Efficient and cost effective service
"Service from start to finish, ordering through website to fit meant at Fairfield garage faultless."
very easy process to get the tyres you want fitted where you want them.
I didn’t have time to research prices so can’t say definite ten. I couldn’t book an appointment time either and the company put that on [REDACTED] shoulders
From the selecting the tyres to having them fitted was spot on.
You sent the wrong tyre to the dealer so I had to make an otherwise unnecessary extra 14 mile extra round trip & waste another 1 1/2 hours as a result
"The website is so easy to use, within 2 minutes I had picked what I needed and had an appointment to have my tyres fitted when it was convenient for me. I arrived and they were ready for me straight away. Will be using [REDACTED] again."
I picked the tyres that you recemended as being a quality tyer but when I received them and had them fitted I looked the brand up that you gave me and they were rubbish and had lots of bad reviews
"They were very helpful with getting through to the chosen garage. They were also willing to call me back rather than be kept on hold in regards to sorting dates/times to bring the car in. [REDACTED] was recommended to me, and I'll definitely recommend them to others!"
"Easy to order the tyres you need, and to get them delivered and fitted at a garage near you is just the icing on the cake."
"Tyres bought at garage directly would have been cheaper. However, never would have looked there"
"easy to order, ideal location to have tyres fitted"
The price was very good and the service convenient and efficient.
Availability of tyres at reasonable prices and a choice of venues to have them fully balanced and fitted.
"Fantabulous service. Josh and Richard were the ultimate dream team at Bar Hill! They were super helpful, friendly and incredibly thorough. I couldn't recommend them more. Thank you boys! (:"
Very competitive prices and a convenient choice of options for fitting.... Great deal!
Recommended to me by a friend. And I have had 3 experiences now using [REDACTED] and have had no issues. Communication has always been excellent.
Price are reasonable and can choose Garage conveniently.All in one place.
The whole process was excellent and the tyres were a good price.
"Excellent service all round. From being easy to navigate the site through to the great partner chosen, my [REDACTED] experience has been excellent."
Okay brought two Goodyear tyers from [REDACTED] fitted at a local tyre service everything good
"Good competitive price. After my order was placed I needed to rearrange the fitting date, the call centre customer advisor was very helpful. Great customer service."
Brilliant. Used [REDACTED] a couple of times now. So easy to use and hard to get a better prices anywhere else. Will be using them again.
Tyres by [REDACTED]. Excellent tyres and value
Good value & excellent service
"Excellent service, as last time, friendly staff!!"
Good prices. Excellent service.
3rd time using and tyres as describedBudget tyre order. 3rd time using and tyres as described with delivery to fitter on time. Nothing more needs to be said. 👍
Excellent service efficient tidy job.
"Great tyres at great prices, why go anywhere else"
Great company and great prices! Entered myself for the draw to win my tyres and won which made it even better!!
Good service. Great value for money.
Tyres for Volvo V70. Good prices and quick fitting
"Reasonably priced, straightforward and hassle free"
good prompt service good deal on tyres
"Great service, very easy to use, decent price."
Ring ahead to the garage to confirm appointment. Great tyre prices Easy to use websiteGood choice of garages and time slots .......However when I got to the garage at the time I was given (10 am ) it was booked on their system at (1.30pm) The garage was more than accommodating and fitted the job in .... above and beyond service next time I will ring the garage to check actual time but I must stress it was not their fault
"Disappointing. Very disappointed- really wanted to have a good experience having heard so much about this company and good reviews.Ordered tyres from a good selection with 2 day turnaround advertised by company. I went for a 5 day fitting and was only advised the day before because I contacted them- having had no appointment sent.Then I’m told it’ll be another week at least before they can get a fitting.No good to me when I’m going on holiday!Never fear: managed to go to a high street garage near my office who managed to get exactly same tyres, at same price within 24hrs and fit......[REDACTED]- don’t think I’ll be bothering you again. Complete waste of my time."
Rubbery Jubbery. We ordered the tyre on the Thursday and had it fitted at the service station of our choice on the Monday. Couldn't have been easier reception staff were good and fitters did the job in no time at all. This is not the first time I have used [REDACTED] and have found them very convenient and economical.
"10 out of 10 is hard to give any one. However prices were good, my choice of fitting place and time."
"The service when the operative was good, but notification of the timings was poor, advised it would happen am, eventually turned up at 5.30pm"
Excellent service Recommended. This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] tyres and they have always been cheaper than the same tyre from a local dealer.I will definitely be using them again. Excellent service.
"CrossClimate fitted by ATS in Galashiels Scottish Borders. I hunted around all our local suppliers and nothing came close to the price of the CrossClimate+ tyres on [REDACTED]. They were over £50 cheaper for a set of four tyres over anything in the Borders and even my usual supplier in Newcastle. I was a bit apprehensive about using ATS in Galashiels for the fitting but they were first class, they took their time to do it properly and exceeded my expectations of a national generic tyre outfit. Overall very impressed and I would happily recommend both [REDACTED] and ATS in Galashiels."
"Great prices, ease of use, massive selection of top brands, well laid out with exact information on-hand. Great and very quick service."
Excellent prompt service. I was very pleased with the prompt and efficient service when replacing my vehicle tyres.The price was also very reasonable and I would not hesitate to use [REDACTED] again.
"Efficient, good price easy to use and good fitter options."
You can choose the tyre you want with no Pressure in your own time think about it go back to it first class
Excellent choice and price. Easy to use website.
Good price very good service
Fast service great choices and price
"Good service, competitive prices!"
"Great easy way of ordering tyres, the fitting centre was very good too"
Everything from ease of use of the website to the price was excellent
It was quick and easy to do it. Good choice of tyres and you don't have to wait more than a week or 10 days to fit tyres. Excellent service. Thanks.
Really simple to use and the garage were very helpful
"easy to order, fitters helpful and pleasant"
"Easy ordering, easy fitting.... at the best price on the market."
quick response when i had a problem & changed and confirmed new details for me
"Good service, easy to use and good value for money"
Great range of tyres. Easy way to order and arrange fitting
Good prices but very random garages
Nice tyres shame about the fitters. The [REDACTED] ordering procedure was absolutely fine only dropped the rating to 4* because the fitters were so surly!
Great service at a great price !!!
Michelin ps4’s We’re cheaper than anywhere else with 10% flash sale. Garage who I usually use were £50 a tyre more expensive but I still used them as they are s [REDACTED] premier fitter so win win all round. Saved £200 and used my regular garage.
Decent wet grip with the tyres i bought. Good service and quick fitting no problems at all.
"Recommended . Great value , great service, easy to use, helpful website & lots of options... recommended!😃😃"
"Great price ,great service!!"
Fitters came to my house and did a fantastic job
"Great Buy. Great price for tyres. Good comms with fitting, happy with purchase."
Very quick reliable service and value for money. Highly recommended
great service all sorted with in minutes of applying then the garage was fantastic
It was Quick and easy to find tyres and get an appointment
As usual excellent service and a good product.
Contact sport5. Saved 10% on the cost of the tyreAnd had it fitted at the place I was going to Use anyway
Hassle free and easy booking
Easy site to use and tyres tend to be a lot cheaper than most companies
Wide choice. Decent price. Quick service
"Website really easy to use. I logged on in the morning, following a flat that required replacement tyre. I booked in to a local garage for the following morning but rang on the off chance that afternoon & they sorted me that day. This is the 3rd time I’ve used [REDACTED] and to be honest I wouldn’t do it any other way now."
"Because the garage you recommended was poor customer service, which cost me more money because of poor workmanship"
I choose [REDACTED] to save money. 245/65/17 Bridgestone at my local garage £136 each. [REDACTED] £100.55 each. When changing all 4 tyres it's a no brainer. Cheers
"Great service, Knighstridge garage are 10/10 top service from start to finish."
Always great service. Easy to order tyres and feels like I'm getting a good price everytime.
Good price & great service
Excellent service and great price
The whole process was so easy. I chose budget tyres but were reassured by other peoples reviews. Online booking was easy. Garage fitting was a breeze.
Competitive pricing.
Easy online booking and recommended by a friend.
Everything was good apart from the lack of communication. I ordered three tyres: the garage fitting said only two were necessary. Tried to ring to see if I could return the third and you NEVER answered at all. So I have a third tyre in the shed!
I have no fault with [REDACTED] ordering system or their availability of tyres however I do not feel that they properly inspect the standard of service being given by their garages. Twice recently I have had poor service from the garage who fitted the tyres. The second occasion could have resulted in a dangerous failure by the garage to not properly tighten wheel nuts due to that job being apparently left to unsupervised trainees. As a result I will not be using that garage again for any purpose.
Barney the manager at the lakeside branch offered great customer service. I had some problems finding my locking wheel but key and missed my slot but Barney still managed fit me in and get the tyres done.
Good price and services
Service was good and at a good price!
"As good as it gets , price ,top service,easy !!"
Tyres did not arrive on day requested
Excellent service and all round customer service
"Have used [REDACTED] for a few years now, and the prices throughout have been great. Its so easy to use and the job is done quickly and without any problems."
"The best way to buy tyres. The best, easiest and cheapest way to buy tyres. 👍"
Easy to order and a great price
Good value. Great flash sale. Always good comparisons too on other brands
Tyres late to arrive
Simple reliable and very keen price sructure
Easy to use website giving great selection of tyres to be delivered to your local garage . Perfect.
"Great value , easy to have tyres fitted ,"
"Quick, polite and no problems even asked me to pop back in anytime after 50 miles to check wheel nuts, which never been asked before."
"Everything was good, 1 point short of 10 as you listed the same tyre at two different prices with no explanation."
Easy to use and excellent prices.
An easy process linked to up to date reviews of various types. Good value
"Thanks. Easy to use website, great price and service"
Good choice of tyres and fitting slots.
A Great Saving. I would thoroughly recommend [REDACTED] for the purchase and fitting of tyres as I have recently saved over £70 when compared to another leading High Street tyre supplier.
Excellent service and price. Tyres fitted at Lloyds BMW of Blackpool who were friendly and helpful.Would definately use again and recommend to friends
Fitted quickly and locally
Cost
I got tyres and the pressure was wrong I had to go back and fix it. They said they will do alignment and they didn t. Not satisfied with the services at all.
Extremely helpful when I arrived
"Fair prices,good services!"
Great price and great fitting service at the Fleet Service Centre.Would highly recommend
Really good service and was the most competitivley priced around. Will certainly buy from them again
Always a good service - always keep in touch every step of the process from ordering to fitting at the garage of your choice. Highly recommended.
Not the cheapest tyres I could find but only a few pounds more. However the firing at the garage was the best quickest I've ever had. Will use you again.
Great service and friendly staff. Nothing to complain about at all.
Hidden charges
Excellent service and good price.
Easy to order at greatly reduced price
Good experience. Quick. Cheap. Great service
Took 1 hour to fit 2 tyres on my vehicle. Would not use garage again.
Effortless and easy to follow process at great prices below the normal routes
"Prefer a time. Would prefer an appointment time , Otherwise good service as arrived before opening time."
The process was easy to follow and felt like good value for money
I find the choice of tyre options is very good across the range. The process is very easy - placing and paying on line - with lots of local choices of fitting centres. It is so easy I do not think I will ever just walk into a fitting centre to buy tyres again
Easy to use and great service from F1
"Easy to use, saves money whats not to like?"
Van 8 perfect as usual! 😁
easy to use saves money whats not to like?
"I was told incorrect information from the offset. Then when I contacted [REDACTED] directly to challenge the information, a customer service advisor maintained that the false information was correct."
"Website good, fitting not so good"
The way to buy tyres. Site was so easy to navigate and the whole process was very good.AND very good competitive price
Competitive price and excellent local service
just really easy to use and most of the time cheaper than most
Excellent service very nice garage staff
"One of the new tyres went flat the day after fitting. I took it back and the valve was faulty. The steering now has a wobble, probably due to the tyre being damaged when it went flat"
Issue not resolved and not happy with the half hearted response I got recently form an incapable complaint handler covering the one that initially dealt with my issue.
Incorrect tyre pressures and wheel bolt torque
The installation service could have been better
Alloy rims were left covered in black grease/ dirt after fitting tyres
"Excellent. Easy and straightforward to order tyres and have them fitted, also very promt and helpful when I had to change the fitting time at last minute . Will use again in future"
"Great service, tyres delivered and fitted when it suited me"
"Prompt, courteous, value for money, will definatelt use again"
So easy to do ordered tyres on line picked what garage I want them to be fitted at and a day that suited me.
"Great value, good service, good communication."
Good value. Tyre good value & garage fitted at is one i usually go to as good service
Value for money and quick reliable service
Great website for great tyres. I've gotten my tyres twice now from this website and both times I've been pleased with the service and the quality of tyres. I'm going to continue to use this site in the future.
great service. easy to use and so much cheaper than anywhere else. thanks again!
Good value for money and good customer service
"Competitive prices, tyres delivered on time to the fitters,"
Cheapest tyres at the time of looking but they have been beaten on price before.
Good service and excellent value. I used [REDACTED] to buy a pair of tyres for my son's car. It was an easy website to use and I found the same tyres on the site. They were delivered to the garage of my choice on the day of my choice. Very good service and value.
"Was very happy with the service received, kept me informed cheap and went to the garage I chose."
"Straight forward. Easy to book, quick and efficient."
"Great service great price, so easy from start to finish"
Excellent service and friendly staff at Silverburn Glasgow.
because I have purchased form [REDACTED] several times without problem and the prices have been competitive and tyres fitted by the same people I would use if I wasn't buying form [REDACTED]!
"Every single time I've used [REDACTED], I've saved money and the whole experience has been simple and trouble-free."
Everything was perfect from start to finish and especially the mobile fitting technician. So much better than waiting around in a garage for ages.
"All went well with the purchase and fitting. Chosen depot, Super Tyres Maldon, were very professional and pleasant to deal with. I had tracking alignment checked."
Very easy ordering and fitting while saving on price Definitely recommend.
Very easy to book and everything went according to the booking.
"Great service, very easy and reasonable prices"
"The best price around. Had the choice of tyres I was looking around for, for a never thought about price. The delivery and fitting schedule was hardly a day away and felt more like a walk-in and change experience. One of the best experience I have had for anything that I could purchase online, along with awesome price."
Very easy way to but tyres. Took it to the local garage and was seen very quickly. Will be using again.
cheapest
Good website how ever bought two tyres off the website within days apart and then they had 15% sale off all tyres. After paying full price .quite annoying really
I was given a fitted time of 9am but when arriving at the garage I was advised this is only a car drop off time. Very misleading.
The only thing was I had to wait in all day for the tyres to be fitted even after I go a appointment for 1 PM it was as 430 5pm.before thenfirter turned up
"Excellent experience, great prices"
New tyres. Quality service at RS Alloy Refurb fit two new tyres to front Nissan qashqai
Very good value for money and very helpful
A great range of tyres which you can browse through at leisure and good prices
quick and efficient best prices available
"Good choice, good price and local fitting"
Great service. Great price. Good timing on the flash sale too.
Very happy with [REDACTED] a you can find you tyres easily and can chose where and when to have tyres changed. I chose to have mine changed at home and the company was very helpful they where able to change sooner but I was not able to be attendance but they completed the work quickly with minimum fuss.
"No issues, quick, easy and competitively priced"
"Great price, very simple"
bad attitude by fitting staff
"Easy to order, easy to arrange to get tyres seen to at a local garage. Will definitely use again"
Cost. Service as described. No problems
Good prices and convenient fitting
Best price on the tyres I wanted
"It was very simple to arrange and I got to chose a garage myself. A friend of mine also did this a year ago and the garage he attended had not marked his tyres as being received so there was some confusion there. I was very lucky, I went to a different garage to avoid this mix-up and they knew my tyres had arrived before I dropped my car off. I would have given it a 10 if I had been given a more specific time slot."
"Mixed feelings. Easy transaction, but car was handed back with the new tyres covered in adhesive which I had to wash off myself. Got the impression that [REDACTED] customers were considered second class"
The choice of tyres is excellent with a range of fitting centres nearby
garage let me down
For me it was a good price.
Selected tyres online. Paid and booked. So easy with no issues. The way it should be. This is the second time I’ve used them.Definitely again.Cheers
Tyres supplied and fitted as requested and at the time specified.
Fitting problems. Everything from placing the order to delivery to fitter went well but fitters were slow I booked a time for 11 am was 12-30 before tyres were fitted and they also lost a centre cap from one of my wheels and I also had to go back to get a dust cap fitted. They claimed the centre cap must have been missing when I took my car in.
"Best prices, hassle free."
"This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] and both times my appointment has been rescheduled the afternoon before, after I have arranged time off from work etc. A service that is meant to take the hassle out of shopping for tyres but instead only creates hassle."
"Having my appointment changed last minute, was very disappointing"
"Pretty smooth process impressed. Pretty smooth process - Order and then go to tyre shop for fitting. Recommended by neighbour and have to say have also been satisfied. Will go this way again so long as [REDACTED] don't try to squeeze the profit margins and whack the prices up. Volume sales and turnover, steady income at moderate profit rather than try to retire in 2 years trying to make a stupid profit. Kwik-fit should be worried. They and others have had this market ring fenced too long with ramped up prices."
"Very straightforward, both order and fitting"
Only 4 stars because my appointment was meant to be 11 o clock and on arrival I was told that it was 12. The garage said it was [REDACTED] miscommunication.
great way to have your tyres done I picked my tyres then chose the fitter and the day and time that I wanted it all happened exactly as arranged good job!
"Good service, quick response when garage struggled to fit me in ."
"Service and price seemed good, only the first time I had used it"
Really easy to use and the tyres cost 25% less than at my usual tyre place.
Excellent service and best prices
"Good service, cheaper than the garages I got quotes from for the same tyres"
"Excellent way to get a competitive price of buying tyres, whilst also getting them fitted with a trustable tyre fitting company. The best of both worlds. Will use this way to get future tyres fitted, thank you"
Excellent service and customer attention
Great convenient service and fantastic garage recommendation
Better than the quick fit bunch. Who just want your money
"Very competitive prices, easy website to navigate and order.One very happy customer, will definitely use again and recommend to friends and family."
great system and really quick to buy and secure an appointment
Quick & efficient service. Competitive prices.
"tyres were good but fitting very poor, Two days after they were fitted the car went in a garage to be serviced and some of the wheel nuts were loose."
Highly recommended. Recommend by my friend to try [REDACTED] . Choose premium quality tyre and price was cheaper than any other site .Paid and Selected garage within one mile radius of my home .Arrived 5 minute before and my slot was attended by staff straightaway.Waiting area was nice and comfy .Got both tyre done with alloygator in 1hts 20 minute .Other workshop charge extra to change tyre if you have alloygator .Welldone for fantastic work.
Very happy with the service given to me. I arrived 10 minutes early and the lads jumped straight on my car while I waited. I am very protective over my car as she’s my pride and joy so I did watch them from start to finish. It’s nice to see them do it by the book without using a nut gun. Thankyou. I went to a different garage later that day as I needed the fronts urgently and couldn’t wait for your delivery time and they used a nut gun and didn’t removed the old wheel weights before balancing. They also charged an extra £15 a tyre. Your team are great I will be using [REDACTED] in the future as of now.
"Easy to use website, good value tyres, good service at garage."
"Quick process. Very easy to use, fast process when using finance too. Not too happy about having to pay a settlement charge before the interest goes on at 6 month. But that's the finance company not [REDACTED] still prices are still good."
"Service 100 percent , fitting station 100 percent All round perfection"
Great prices and fast delivery. Four cars in my household and use [REDACTED] every time . Wouldn’t go anywhere else !
"Terrible after service, communication is non existing if you have a problem."
"Process was clear and simple. Only problem was that I didn't input discount code, my fault entirely. Mid-Devon Tyres service was excellent."
Easy to shop online and thr fitting was first class
"Two weeks later and the Tyre's still haven't arrived! Customer support seem to be ignoring their tickets taking days to respond. Had a fault with a tyre and needed these tyres urgently, so went out of my way to get them. But its been a disaster of an experience."
Well priced products
"Good prices, great service, and,most importantly, friendly staff. What more can I say."
Very good price for premium tyres. Fitted at a local garage with no issues whatsoever
The whole experience from purchasing the tyres on line and to then having them fitted was faultless.
Great prices and friendly staff
You told me to go early that the garage took first come first served which was wrong
"Easy, good prices, at a time that suits you."
Wheels were damaged and it’s taken a week and still no response to request for resolution
"I've used [REDACTED] before, and in conjunction with A2 Tyres in Sittingbourne, the service has been exemplary. I have no complaints and no adverse criticism to offer. I'll be back."
Easy to find and fast delivery
"Great service, easy to use and very quick. Prices are good too"
Good range and great value
Very easy and the cheapest on the market... many options for fitting.
From start . To fitting of tyres no fuss Good value
"Good service but impacted on a score of 10 by being told tyres were not delivered to my tyre fitting centre and would have to re-arrange a date. However 15 minutes before scheduled time received a call to say they were there and could I visit immediately for fitting. On arrival, told by the centre the tyres were there the day before!!"
Decent prices and easy to use.
"Tyres that are easy to order at a great price with a choice of fitting centres, I have used [REDACTED] for my last three sets of tyres , even used you for a replacement after suffering a puncture on holiday in Cornwall,"
"It was so easy from ordering, booking in to a local garage then just turning up for the fitting."
Fast efficient and value for money
The information about each tyre on the website was fantastic and the whole process so easy. Best way I've ever bought tyres.
"Competitive pricing, everything on time, good service."
"Great price, smooth service"
"Used before, good prices, easy to navigate website"
Good value for money and good service.
Efficient and effective
Used twice; hassle free; good range and competitive prices on website
Easy to use site with a great price and easy service
Shopped around and found them to be the best price.
Good price. Excellent service. Very convenient.
good but bit of a wait for an appointment
Easy and quick booking and great price
Spot on service at the right price. Used [REDACTED] for various tyres over the last few years and never been disappointed.
"Easy process. Good value on price. Time will tell on the quality of the tyre, [REDACTED] own brand. So far so good."
Price & convenience
Really poor service only advising me 15 mins prior that they were cancelling my booking.
"Perfectly fine. Very easy process, fitting centre customer service was quite lacking though so would use again but not at that fitting centre."
"Great service, a little higher than average on price, but that is balanced out by a wider range."
"It is a good service that I would recommend however it depends on the Individual garage involved, In my case this was a good experience and my tyres were fitted promptly but this may vary."
Excellent and easy service to use. No hassle getting the tyres fitted at the local garage. All round 10/10 from me
Because the price was great but there is obviously an issue booking time slots. As in I chose a time and date but then a day later am told the slot is no longer available and get offered one that doesn’t fit in with my work schedule on another day.
I arrived late due to unforseen circumstances and the chaps at the garage were still able to fit me in... Thanks!
"Easy to use, efficient and good prices."
Price and service
"Good price, easy to order"
"Good price, no hassle."
Website easy to use and book local garage.
It's fab to be able to order tyres easily online and then get to choose a convenient garage to fit them.
Efficient and easy to use service and very competitively priced tyres.
Reliable and VFM
Easy to order and good to get a time slot
From ordering to fitting straight forward and easy . Fitting was hassle free excellent service and most of all very reasonably priced .
Straightforward source for tyres. Good choice of tyres. Easy to order and arrange fitting. Lots of helpful information on the website.
In principal the concept is good but not sure if it was time saving or the best price
easy to purchase from site and fitted 5 mins walk from home! Only issue was my fault buying budget tyres for my BMW which seem much harder than premium brand and effect the cars handling.
Great service
First class service
Have used for quite a few years. Do a good job.

Easy and good service
Been using [REDACTED] for sometime now and never had a bad experience
"Extremely poor customer service. Received an email the day before saying that they won’t be able to fit my tyres on the selected day. Obviously I had organized myself to be fitted on that day. Replied saying that it was either that day somewhere else or I would have to cancel. Well minutes later got an automated email saying my order was canceled without any sort of explanation, or apologies for a rather poor service. They didn’t even spend a minute trying to find a solution. Won’t go with them ever again even if that means paying more."
Very easy to use

Communication about tyre pressures would have been helpful. Tyres were way overinflated - I had to go elsewhere and deflate them (all) - I have an onboard pressure indicator. Other than that very business like and time appropriate. Overall the process was very good.
its perfect. on time and no problems
Always need something to aim for!
Pleasant experience

Having bought tyres from [REDACTED] before I had no hesitation buying again as the system works like clockwork.

"Easy to use site, double check what your tyre size is First you put your car index plate and it shows the tyres required but advisable to double check Went middle of range as didn’t fully understand the rating for noise and performance"
"I purchased via Quidco on the 9th of June. Now on the 3rd of September, after numerous emails MY cashback has been declined as you claim I used a voucher. This is untrue. Clearly you can't be trusted, and you will most certainly not be getting any further custom from me or any sort of recommendation other than a strongly worded avoid."
All went really
Exactly as described and expected. Recommended.
Excellent service! Will use again for sure! A++
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my usual tyres didn't come up as an option. I had to search quite hard to find them.I would expect that your regular tyres should be first on the list.Apart from that the service was great and painless.
"They tried hard selling me tracking, I had it done 6 months ago"
Found this on Web search for finding the best results on tyres
Was recommended by a friend

"The site and experience was pretty good. If you're looking for a specific tyre or couple of tyres that you've already researched, the search facility on the site is a bit hit and miss. The order was also problematic as it didn't give any confirmation the order was complete, and when I rang up to check, the agent said there were two orders in process!"
Efficient and straightforward service.
Everything was good and quick
"Tyres. I use them all the time, great choice, great service"

Fantastic service.....would use them again

"1010. It was so easy and hassle free, I will definitely use [REDACTED] again in the future and I am more than happy to recommend them."
"It's a first class service that makes buying tyres very easy, I have been using your company for many years now."
Martin. Good service
"Too busy as always. As always I’m too busy to be messing around and burning up precious time for things like tyres. [REDACTED]; I’ve used them before and will use them again, simple."
"Got there in the end, the first tyre I ordered was not comparable with my car as I was told so by my fitting garage, so had to go back to bc and find the right one , other than that v happy, have used bc for years and no problems"
I cant find a reason to give less
Better than stapletons
"Provided good service, no issues. Have used this company before and without a doubt would used then again"
Excellent. As per previous uses excellent service.
"Great service, really easy and flexible around my plans."
Tyres. Everything was as it said on the tin.
"Really convenient service, no need to go around tyre shops wasting time and getting ripped of, no need to handball tyres if you order online."
Process simple and straightforward
"The online process was very easy and quick, Very satisfied."
Great service worked very well
Every aspect worked as advertised.
Just so easy to do
After a bad starting experience....we got there in end with good result
Brilliant quick and efficient service at the touch of a button
Simple order process and self selection of fitting site
Doesn't offer all tyres
Ordered tyres on Monday lunchtime and had tyres delivered and fitted at an arranged fitter on Friday morning. All went smoothly without a hitch!
Good tyres and good price
simple to use and it has good prices
Lovely staff efficient purchasing will use them again
Ordering the tyres was very easy. Great service from the fitter as well.
Good price and reasonable service
Got exactly what I ordered when I was told I will get it at the best price on the market.
Good service - website was easy to use. Had my tyres on my car in the garage I wanted and the day I wanted
"Good price and effective system, the local garage hadn't kept their availability up to date but this wasn't [REDACTED] fault and they handled the resolution effectively. I am a contented repeat customer and will look to use the service next time I need tyres."
"[REDACTED] are easy to deal with. Just visit on line, choose your tyres then the fitters and time/date. That's it job done."
Excellent choice with good prices to match
"Easy to order tyres on website . Then select local fitting centre . All within 2 -3 days of placing order . Prices are excellent , will certainly be buying from [REDACTED] in the future ."
"Fantastic service, just a bit busy and nowhere to park and wait"
"Top price for tyres and fitting, but would like to see saperate tyre drop off at selected garage and tyre fitting time on invoice, because local garage will consider your appointment after tyre drop off not the one you have selected during purchase."
Very easy and convenient to use
"Tyres fine and on time. Payment took more than an hour. I use the credit card and mobile very regularly to carry out similar transactions, but it continued to fail for a long time."
"great price, got booked in quickly. happy with the service."
"Easy process of identifying and ordering correct tyres, then choosing and booking the time with the preferred fitter"
Quick and efficient experience
Job well done. 4 Michelin tyres fitted at a very good price.Thanks.
No problem at all.
"Excellent service, couldn't fault anything. Cheapest website by far. Very informative through the whole process."
"Easy, quick and reliable service. Will definitely use again in the future."
"Good price, nothing hidden and an easy process."
Great guys. Great friendly service. Would recommend to anyone.
They got the job done right in a timely manner. Would definitely recommend.
Price was good and choice of fitting locations is helpful. Generally satisfied with [REDACTED].Just 2 issues:- Once a fitting service is selected you are given a calendar to select the day and time. Having selected an early morning time for my convenience at the designated supplier i was contacted later and told the time selected wasnt available. That was less convenient.The supplier selected was the nearest & most convenient but they were a mainstream BMW garage and not a specialist tyre fitter. They were clearly more focused on their BMW customers and despite clear instructions fitted the replacement tyre on the wrong wheel. This was apologetically rectified but resulted in the fitting of one tyre taking 2 hours. Instead of being fitted and on my way by 9-00 am as originally planned it was gone 12-00 when the job was completed.
Great value - saved £30 on the next best quote. Really efficient service - quickly got a date for fitting at a very convenient location. Tyres fitted quickly at the garage and paperwork completed in seconds!
Simple website and excellent service with [REDACTED] and my chosen fitters.
"Unfortunately, you can't beat their prices, but I've had some mixed experiences, and I'm struggling to trust the honesty / integrity of the company as a whole.1) I booked a fitted service for my wife's car, and was given a timed appointment, which was really inconvenient (no choice of times), so I called customer service to see if it could be changed ""let me check with the garage"" said the lady on the phone, followed by ""the garage has no other availability on that day"", etc, etc. So I called the garage directly and explained that I'd like to come earlier if possible and got ""no problem sir, come along for when we open, and we'll get you straight in""... did customer service actually speak with the garage, given how accommodating they were when I called, I doubt it!2) Different garage, and 4 tyres for my car... I had a very poor experience where it apparently took the garage 2 hours 10 minutes to change 4 tyres, and a very muddled experience from start to finish... they didn't have my paperwork, couldn't find my tyres, were questioning whether I was there on the right day, etc. and then the length of time to actually change the tyres, whilst mechanics floated aimlessly around the garage doing nothing. I took the time to write a detailed review of the garage on the [REDACTED] website, but that review hasn't been published weeks on, and the garage still has a 5 star rating, leading me to believe that [REDACTED] are trying to protect the reputation of their premier partner garages despite customer experiences."
Excellent service top of the range tyres cheap
very easy process and good value
Needed to change tyres and did it on the phone easily and got them fitted at a time that worked for me
Great team at Handforth dean
"Fast, efficient, value for money"
"Paid and booked a slot which was cancelled by [REDACTED] less than 24 hours before I was due to attend. They rescheduled without speaking with me and failed to reply to 2 emails sent in response to their email. They have offered me a £20 refund for the experience but I am yet to receive this one week after the appointment. It took over an hour for the ATS to fit the two tyres, previous experience suggests that that was a little extended.....good job they prefer free coffee"
Tyres were competitively priced and I have had no problems.
Excellent service every time I have used them. Great value for money.
Good price and very flexible timings and dates for appt.
Excellent service from choosing online to booking fitting. Service was excellent at ATS in Hereford will use again.
"Very easy to order and select a fitter, with a massive selection of tyres to choose from. I chose ATS Euromater to fit mine, who were very good! I took my car in at 9am as booked and got taken in straight away, EXCELLENT!"
"Very Good service my alloys are a little corroded on the rim resulting in them needing pumping up every few days.The technician picked up on this and advised for a small fee they could dress and prep the rim to help with the problem.This was done and the new tyres now stay inflated, so overall was very satisfied with the service recived."
Very competitive with local suppliers.At least you can choose from a selection of local fitting garages and not be obliged to go to one that you maybe don't favour from past experience. Delivery to them is fast enough for most folk.
"Have used before and will use again, cannot fault this company. Excellent price, product and service."
Tyres not delivered on the booked day at specified garage. Probably courier problem.2 days late.
"Easy to use website,great communication and garage was excellent and efficient."
Good value plus excellent fitting service
Very easy ordering process and options on which local tyre fitter to use. Very competitive prices and would definitely use again and recommend
OneStop in Stirling were excellent. Great service.
"I’ve now purchased tyres from [REDACTED].com on 3 occasions and each time I have found very competitive prices, a really easy process, tyres are always delivered on time, good communication from [REDACTED].com throughout and the website is both informative and clear. Recommended!"
Used [REDACTED] twice now and happy with the selection and price of tyres. My local garage fit them and I rate the service highly.
First class service at a discount price
Simple quick and very cost effective. What lore do to need!?
"Great price, quick service and superb quality tyres. [REDACTED] we're brilliant communicating with me when the garage had a problem fitting me in on the slot I selected online and were great and making sure I was booked in as soon as possible. Would totally recommend this service to all car users!"
"Great service. Chose the tyres, chose the garage and everything worked out perfect."
Prompt professional service. Will recommend to all and use again. Tyres fitted within the allotted time in 35 mins.
Excellent service from operator who was friendly and professional and went out of his way to assist with the repair work.
Tyre purchase and fitting made easy. Literally got everything sorted within a few minutes. Third time I have used this service and will be using it again in the future
"Excellent, helpful service. Delivered on time at reasonable cost."
Tyres are very reasonable for price and quality you select. It is really easy to order and pay for them. Delivered to the garage of my choice and they were there in plenty of time. Would recommend this company
"Ordered my tyres online and picked the place, day, and time well in advance, as this was the only day I could manage, and got the conformation email. 3 days later they emailed saying they could not do that day or time, and I would have to pick another day, which was no use to me as I would be working. They then said I could change the garage and get the same day, but I had to pick up the tyres from the first garage and take them with me to the other garage.So again got the confirmation email with the day and time and new garage a little further away, but when I arrived home that evening....they had sent another email saying they had changed the time from 9.30 to 1.30 in the after noon without asking me. Again this time was no use to me, so I had to pick up the tyres, go to the other garage to see if they could help me out, which I am glad to say they did, but no thanks to [REDACTED]."
The whole process is way easier than the other high street tyre place... very good price and easy to book in. Second time I’ve used [REDACTED] in last 6 months and would definitely use again. Also impressed by our local ATS who are the fitting partner for them.
Tyres easy to order and a competitive price. Tyres fitted by ATS Evesham at appointed time. All staff pleasant and helpful. I'm a happy customer.
"Did what it said on the tin! Ordered my tyres online at a good price, selected my local garage - people that I know and trust - the tyres arrived in time for my appointment. The garage did its stuff, with no pressure selling add-ons. Altogether a good experience."
Everything was as good as I expected. The 4 tyres look good and the fitting balancing etc. was done in 45mins
I recommend!
Convenient service and competitive price with discount code
Quick and easy. Wu
"Very happy with purchase, process and fitter."
Very competitive price wise but this is completely irrelevant when you have to pay a garage an hours labour a week later because they need rebalancing.
"Excellent service and quality as usual.... excellent grip, super quiet tyres especially for the price....Highly recommend [REDACTED].com"
"Great service, would recommend and will use again"
Excellent service as usual from [REDACTED] / Brackley MOT & Service Centre. Will be happy to use them again.
"Got a pair of top notch tyres for mid-range price. Local fitting was first class, even offered a cup of coffee while I waited.Excellent."
Fast efficient service. Helpful staff at ATS. Booked time and date easily to suit myself.
Easy to find the right tyres and had the best local fitters to me.
"Excellent service, hassle free"
"Everything went very smoothly, and on time. I will definitely use them again."
"Slightly unfair rating because it was the chosen garage that let [REDACTED] down.Choosing, pricing, ordering, paying and setting up a fitting appointment all easily done.Unfortunately the fitter changed the wrong two tyres and left one dangerous tyre still on the car, only for me to notice on collection."
"Very competitive prices, fabulous service, friendly staff!I recently had a tyre fitted at [REDACTED], Bar Hill (Cambs) and have no complaints at all. The man who served me was really nice, the fitting was completely promptly and the price was good."
"Greatest customer service ever. By far the greatest customer service I have ever received! The team is incredibly supportive and quick to respond, even though there was some issues (my own fault) these guys were fantastic to respond and quick to resolve them!"
Excellent service. Tyres delivered and fitted as arranged.
"Easy to order, good service at the garage"
"The purchase online was simply, the customer support via email/phone was excellent. And finally the fitting was seamless.From start to finish it was a positive experience"
"No problems at all, really easy, would definitely recommend and will be using [REDACTED] again :)"
A much more convenient way to have tyres replaced. I have used [REDACTED] the last few times now and have no complaints.
Awesome Service
ordered 4 tyres online - booked in to a tyre fitter on my way home from work at a time that suited me! Tyres were there and fitted in 20 mins - no stress an great prices!
"Good pricing, excellent communication, all happened as it should,"
Excellent yet again. Easy to choose your tyres with great prices. ABC who fitted our tyres in Cheltenham provide a better quality service and always on time.
Really pleased. Straight-forward online ordering and payment. Technician called ahead to advise expected arrival and was on time. Fitting was carried out effectively and efficiently.Recommended and would use again.
Easy to book appointment to have tyres fitted when it suited me. Tyre fitting was easy with a great fitting shop. Very friendly and helpful staff
Always had perfect service from start to completion of goods purchased at right price
Friendly professional service
Easy to use website. Good selection of tyres at reasonable prices. The option to have the tyres fitted at home at a time to suit the customer is a definite advantage. Would definitely recommend this company.
Very good service. I had to recheck the appointment they gave me. It turned out the tyre services I was to visit had changed hands that week. [REDACTED] promptly rearranged with another local fitter and all went smoothly.
Great price for the tyres and fitted locally with no hassles. great service
Excellent service with hassle free fitting at tyre spot
"Easy to find tyres, ordering simple Local fitters very good"
"Second car tyre change. Very friendly, helpful staff. Affordable prices. Great service. Thank you, definitely suggesting to everyone!"
A good way to buy tyres and have used twice before...Would definitely recommend
Convenient enough but had to wait 3 extra days for fitting due to not being delivered and then the garage said they could of done me 2 tyres cheaper üòÇ but after they fitted them
Excellent service and good value for money. Would recommend to anyone.
"I have used [REDACTED] for a few years now and their prices are always very keen, their service in terms of information and arranging fitting is first rate and the fitters they use are both polite and helpful. I cannot see any reason why everyone does not use them."
"Can't fault the service . Buy and book on line. Turn up, tyres fitted, drive away. Guys at Silverburn more than helpful after I had made a backside of my order !"
Easy to use web site. Good choice of tyres. Competitive pricing. Good choice of quality fitting centres.
Excellent service from both yourselves and Rivermead garage Crewkerne. Many thanks.
Very easy booking and reasonably priced tyres. Will definitely recommend.
"I have used [REDACTED] several times with no problems. Easy, appointment time at local garage. Check prices online, pay for your choice, go get fitted. Like!"
"Great prices, plenty of choises for tyres and fiting garages, good experience overall!"
Tyres delivered as arranged. First class fitter who really knew his stuff.

very good prices and service
"Consistently great brands, fantastic prices, a choice of outstanding fitting centres and on a date and time of your choice. Coupled with outstanding customer service, what else could you ask for?I have used [REDACTED] for years and cannot fault them. They take great pride in their service and seem to use only the best fitting centres so that you get exactly what you expect time after time."
"Simple, straightforward, easy to use website, good prices - what‚Äôs not to like !"
They did what they said they would. No fuss.
Excellent result. Easy to find correct tyres. No problems. Garage very efficient.
everything went as smooth as you could ever want
Price and service all good - no complaints at all.
"This is the first time I have used [REDACTED] and probably the last. I thought it would be easy to book a local garage for 2 new back tyres. The booking went well, however the later that day I had an email to say that the garage was unable to accommodate my booking and to pick a new date. How can your systems allow us to book an appointment if the appointment is not available? I had to wait over a week for another appointment which was convenient. I am not sure if I would use this process again."
Excellent service from the tyre fitting centre and great support from the customer services team. Cannot fault [REDACTED].
"First time using. I couldn't ask for a better service.This service is so convenient,cost effective and professional. I would recommend to anyone."
"Easy to use website, great value tyres fitted at my local garage with no problems, highly recommend."
Always had no problems with [REDACTED].Booking went ok Will continue to purchase from them in future.
"Good advice and service, reasonable prices."
"Job done quickly and efficiently, polite staff, overall excellent service"
"Cheapest fitted price for our tyre choice. Very straightforward from checking tyre size by registration number to purchasing and arranging fitting all on same website, at same time. Have used [REDACTED] before for our other car and would use again. Would have no hesitation in recommending them to others."
"Have been getting tyres from [REDACTED] for many years now.Always had excellent service and the prices are always good.I've used [REDACTED] approved garages both in Chester and London, all have been great."
Easy and convenient to book a nearby tyre fitter.
Very easy too use website and the tyre prices are reasonable as well.
The booking was good and the service was quick and efficient.
"Great Service, good prices"
Excellent fast service!
It was an amazing experience. Easy and cheaper way to buy the tyres. I strongly recommend [REDACTED] 😃👍
Excellent service and good choice of tyre fitters.
Good quick efficient service
Tyres replaced without a hitch appointment arranged and completed on time
"Competitive, efficient and a convenient way to buy tyres"
Great product and great service from garage that fitted tyres. No negatives whatsoever. Highly recommended.
"Good system, good service, good prices.Does exactly what it says on the tin (web site). Good value and range of tyres. Local fitting worked perfectlyVery happy all round."
Ordered tyres easily. Fitted in local workshop. All OK. Many thanks.
Great priceGreat service Can’t fault
Got the exact tyres that I wanted at a very competitive price and fitted locally (within 1 mile) in just 3 days. Couldn't really ask for more.
Mr tyres are very professional in fitting & balancing wheels and tyres
Price comparison was best for deal while also having the convience of picking a garage and date.
Fantastic service Great guys recommended
"Best price. Tyres delivered to garage of my choice at a time of my choosing. Fit, balance, valve and disposal of carcasses included. Job done!"

Great tyres. Car runs a lot smoother and quieter.

Excellent service and great value for money. Completely hassle free
Still waiting for refund
"First time booking tyres on line, this was easy with tyres to be fitted at local garage."
"Good service, good prices."
"I bought my preferred tires and booked the mobile fitter online with [REDACTED]. The tires were the best price on line and I chose the day and time(am or pm) for the mobile fitter It took me about 10 minutes.It was so easy I thought it was to good to be true.The mobile fitter arrived on time with the tires and the job was completed (2 tires) in under 30 minutes, I did not have to do a thing.The future is Mobile for me and my family."
No fuss purchase and booking for tyre fitting. I always use [REDACTED] to purchase tyres and fit them at my local ats at a time that's covenient for me. The prices are always competitive and the convenience of selecting a garage and time for fitting saves me time. Highly recommended.
Straightforward. Happy with the tyres and the fitting. Will use [REDACTED] again
"Tyres arrived on time, sadly Bathwick Tyres who fitted the tyres were rude and unhelpful. They didn’t conduct allignment check, I had to wait three hours for the tyres to be fitted. Poor service!!"
"This is a first for me, two bad reviews about the same thing.I left a review the other week after I was badly let down on an order half an hour before close of business on bank holiday weekend.They posted some banal platitudes in response and somebody duly emailed me to apologise.Then the funny bit.. you can only laugh, what else can you do.Along with the apology I was offered a £20 gift voucher and a 10% discount on future orders by somebody called Katrina. I emailed a response, she never got back to me. I chased it a few days later.....nothing.Given the original issue was the abysmal handling of the problem, it beggars belief that their `Support Team` can't even follow through on an offer. Pathetic, [REDACTED] but I'm sure you couldn't care less!!"
"The cost was very competitive and the workshop that fitted the tyres didn't find unnecessary additional work, were courteous and efficient- thanks."
"All good, used the mobile tyre service they offer and they turned up on time were polite and tyre prices on par with elsewhere. Will use again"
I‚Äôm a repeat customer and always find that the value and service are competitive and I get to use my favourite local dealership
"Ordered, Paid, Delivered, Fitted. Perfect... Thanks"
Very good service and good communication
"My tyres were out of stock for a few days so I couldn't complete my order but once back in everything was easy to arrange and get sorted. Annoyingly the garage didn't operate with an actual time,they worked in morning or afternoon slots - I arrived after the school run and had to wait over an hour before they could even start on my car. Thankfully it was within walking distance to some shops so I managed to waste some time there rather than being bored waiting. Had to pay an additional cost for wheel alignment which apparently my car needed...though you never know how true that fact is or if they must wanted to earn some actual money themselves. I would use [REDACTED] again but may use a different garage that worked with actual times so I can plan my day better."
"issues with supply, communication and still issues with suspect balancing with my tyres"
Excellent service will be using them again
"All The Staff Were Very Helpful,Nothing Was To Much Trouble,Would Recommend This Copmpany To Anyone Requiring New Tyres."
Very good service would recommend [REDACTED]
"Quick, efficient and simple to use."
Very professional service.
"From start to finish the process was simple, the tyres were the cheapset I could find, easy to order and ready at the depot when the date for fitment arrived"
Excellent system.
"No stock of tyres advertised and paid for, promised update, had to chase and tyres sent out when I did therefore stock in and not updated to me plus requested to apply my coupon for 10% discount received during 2weeks waiting. No response therefore no acknowledgement, tyres received and still no acknowledgement"
Great price and tyres always available when they say they will be
Easy hassle free
"This is the third time I have had the pleasure of dealing with [REDACTED]. Yes, I checked the competition but, yet again, they were still the most reasonable. I will not say cheap as I bought Michelins and they never are cheap. Still, two for my Mercedes for £168 is pretty good going. The garage I chose had not had a review before but I was moved to write one for them after the great customer experience I received. I am sure I shall be a customer of [REDACTED] again, Thank you."
Always an efficient reliable service
"The process was beautifully smooth. I got decent tyres, at a great price, fitted at a convenient time, by a local specialist that I already knew and trusted, all organised in seconds on the [REDACTED] website. It's all the better, because my car is a 1971 sports car, and most tyre fitters (including the big high-street franchises) couldn't even get tyres in the right size.Will definitely use again."
"OK so they don't stock every variant (Eg couldn't find an ""acoustic"" version of Michelin Primacy 3) but all in all a very good service, very competitive pricing and quick delivery. £50 cheaper per tyre fitted at a tyre centre who could beat their price."
Tyres arrived at garage unlabled and were fitted to someone else’s car. Not impressed. Wasted a day off work. Poor service.Garage were then supposed to ring me the day after when tyres arrived. They rang me 4 days later. Poor show
Website easy to use. The experience from the shop was very good. Overall I would definitely use this service again.
"Best way of buying tyres, select, choose fitting location and decide when you want it done. always been a great service."
Your service was very good and I will definitely work with you again.
Good job was done when I had to be out of my home. very quickly and on time. Good job guys. keep like this
No complaints. Efficient service and good price.
Ordered my tyres online literally in a few touches of a button. There was a delay in my order which wasn't ideal but I was kept informed at every stage and actually were given an upgrade in my tyre choice as compensation.
Good price and supplied quickly.
"First time using the website and will be using it again!, Love the range that the site has to offer for tyres and prices competitively.If you are getting your newly purchased tyres fitted by black-circles partnered garage, I would call the garage of choice before confirming to use that garage to make sure that your tyre will be fitted at the time you specified or to make special requests and to gauge the customer service of the garage. I found that some garages wasn't as friendly as others! Definitely Recommend this site! (Had the tyres replaced May 2019)"
It was really easy to find a garage near me which fitted the tyres when I wanted. Excellent service.
The service was brilliant and the garage was quick in changing my tyres
Quick & Great service
"[REDACTED] performed perfectly on a previous occasion when a full set of 4 branded tyres was purchased, I've marked them down as their attitude this time on a pair of Own brand [REDACTED] tyres was frustrating ( I wonder why). ordered Friday for fitting Tuesday postponed by phone till Wednesday as the items had missed the pick up.Then postponed on Monday to Thursday then Friday ! An exchange of e mails complaining about re arrangement at which point they made the day, Thursday, with ATS all went perfectly.A 10% discount and a promo code for next time helps but really!!!"
Wrong tyres slow refund bad customer service
"Guys were great, really helpful and I treated myself to dinner in local shopping centre while they fitted 4 tyres for me"
First time user of [REDACTED]. Buying and fitting of 2 replacement tyres went smoothly.
"Easy to use site, excellent prices and great communication"
Smooth easy process. The fitting garage said they couldn't get anywhere near their prices. Will use again... a no brainer.
"Second time using [REDACTED] for tyres on our car. Perfect. No complaints at all and very easy. The garage we opted for, ATS in Plymouth, was also very good. I would recommend both without hesitation."
It was easy to order stuff and select the local garage to replace the tyres! i'll recommend to people to use it. Best price and good deal!
Buying and getting my tyres fitted through [REDACTED] was a very pleasant and hassle free experience. I will definitely use them again in future.
I had three tyres replaced. The locking nut on one of the wheels was missing. After going back and emailing still nothing has been done two weeks on. No communication either.
"Really easy process to order, organise suitable garage and appointment time. Great price too!Will use again."
"Quick, convenient and competitively priced."
"website quick and easy to use , prices excellent, choice of local garages to suit and fit around work, great communication via email and texts - would not hesitate to recommend or use again"
"Great website, easy to use and excellent value. Will definitely use again"
Excellent value and first class service
I was looking for a new tyre for my corsa I looked online but could not find the right one tried different sites no luck then I tried [REDACTED] very easy to find what I was looking for at a great price booked me in with a local garage all very easy
Wrong tyres sent to garage - had to rebook tyre fitting on another day. Offered a 10% refund as an apology - never credited to account.
"Arrived within promised time window. Friendly, efficient and knowledgeable staff member. Tyres very good value as well!"
"Best and Worst Experience. The fitter claimed that they balanced the wheels afterwarsd but after 5 minutes of driving, my fillings in my teeth were falling out after the amount of shaking the car was doing. Also the fitter lost a locking wheel nut and damaged all the plastic caps that protect the bolts. However after speaking with the [REDACTED] team, they were extremely applogetic and covered the costs of getting this errors corrected. So overall the best and worst experience was had."
Excellent website. Excellent service.
Great service very easy to select tyres and book appointment
"The process is easy, choose the tyres , delivered to a garage near your house, fitted with no issues. Would highly recommend"
"I ordered a pair of Avon tyres which I have used for years. There were cheaper tyres on offer but I would rather use a trusted brand. When I went to collect my car a pair of ""Cooper"" tyres had been fitted. Apparently these are the new owners of Avon & ""equivalent"". If that had been made clear on the website or I had been told that I might get a brand I haven't heard of thats equivalent before hand I would have bought something else. You don't necessarily get what you pay for with [REDACTED] so I won't use them again."
All 4 tyres fitted in the time I was told. Friendly and helpful staff as usual. Great job 👍
"Great price, but beware fitment does NOT include the standard practise of swapping rear tyres to the front. You WILL be charged extra for this by their fitment partner. We were charged the princely sum of £15 for the privilege."
I arrived at the garage slightly earlier as requested. It was explained that another job had to be finished before me but it would only take a few minutes. This was the case and the new tyre was soon fitted and all the paperwork completed.
Excellent prices and a plenty of options in all price brackets. Communication was great and the customer service of the garage was fab. Will definitely use again. Highly recommend the service
Great price for the tyres and easy ordering process
I went to the garage and had my 2 front tyres changed on my 2016 Audi A3. Was informed by the fitter that they had fitted them ok but wouldn't be able to set up the tracking as that had to be done by Audi as they didn't have the manufacturers equipment or something. Not really happy about that. More money and time.
"Great tyres at the best price on the internet including fitting at a garage less than a mile away, couldn’t be a happier customer!"
"Great prices, fully recommended :). Thank you."
Tyres arrived at my nominated Garage in time for my Car's MOT. Prompt service and reasonably priced. Would use again.
"Fantastic website - easy to use and order, fitting equally good at local garage - first class in every aspect"
"Great variety, easy to buy and book, professional install."
Great fast service.
"Good prices, punctual appointment, but tried to sell wheel alignment and left me with tyre pressure almost 10psi over limit."
"Ordered two Hankook sport tyres for my Seat Leon Cupra - one fitted OK by local fitter, but the other deflated immediately it was blown up and the fitter found a slit in the tyre - what sort of quality control that allows this to happen? Had to take my car back the next day and waste more of my time - really - 24 hours to deliver a replacement tyre in the Bristol area these days?Not a good experience, and not great for future confidence in Hankook or [REDACTED] either."
All aspects of the purchase were easily completed
Excellent service fitted at our local garage at very competetive prices.
Good prices - good service !
"This is one of the best services on the web. I have used [REDACTED] several times with different cars and I have always been impressed by the range of available tyres, the price and the speed of fitment at a local tyre fitting garage."
[REDACTED] were great delivered tyre I ordered to the nearest garage that fits for them but the garage cracked and damaged my under shield on my car and now it hangs down a thought people who work with car lifts would know where to put the pads when putting car on lift and not damage my car.
"No problems at all, appointment on time and sorted within 45 minutes"
[REDACTED] tyres are a great price and Cecil street garage done a great job.
"Fast, efficient, good value."
Excellent Service AAA
good service. good price. No problems. Booked a time and got my car back 45 minutes later.
I was very happy with the service the tires have made a great difference to the car a lot quieter in the cab of my Mondeo the Michelin primacy 4 our exceptional tyres make the car feel really grippy on the road will definitely buy them again
"I just bought 4 expensive run flat tyres for my Mercedes for 60% of the cost the dealer wanted and 10% cheaper than I found elsewhere. I'm sure you can find cheaper tyres, but I believe that tyres are one area you want the best quality you can get at a good price, and [REDACTED] won this time, as they have in the past.I ordered them to be fitted at my local ATS on a weekend when I had time. I arrived 10 minutes before my appointment and my car went straight in. 40 minutes later everything was done and sorted. Simple and straightforward."
"[REDACTED] is an excellent website, easy to use with a good range of competitively priced tyres. Making a booking with a local garage was easy and the fitting service went smoothly. Have used [REDACTED] several times."
"Excellent choice or tyres, kept well informed of fitting date and time. ATS did the fitting, all in all could not have been better"
"Easy to navigate website, good selection of tyres at competitive prices with all the information you need to make your choice !"
Really pleased with every aspect of both buying on line and having tyres fitted locally.
"Excellent service from start to finish. Had a few questions so rang the helpline, they didn't know the answer and promised to get back to me the next day, 9am following morning I had an answer by email! They even helped me SAVE money!Fitting was carried out at home and they rang me before they arrived, and £6 for the job. Would highly recommend [REDACTED] and will definitely use them again."
Reasonable price. Good service at fitting centre. No air guns used and wheel nuts tightened by hand with a torque wrench. Don’t see that often.
"Easy to order on line with fantastic price, delivered direct to the recommended fitting garage near my home. Excellent tyres, will be ordering two more tyres in a week. Definitely using the same garage for my car service and MOT. Highly recommended."
Excellent service from both supplier and partner garage. Tyres arrived on time (even on East coast of N. Yorks.) and were just as described.
Excellent and fast services
Top product. Best price. Rapid fitting. Very happy customer.
Tyres I wanted fitted at home. Excellent service
Good service with tyre at good price
"I return to [REDACTED] time after time, excellent service and fantastic relationship with local fitter......couldn’t ask for better."
if you can wait a day or so for your new tyres you will save lots
"I always use [REDACTED]. The web site is easy to use and always gives a good comparison. Having the tyres fitted is trouble free. You choose your tyres, book the venue and time, turn up and within 30 mins you are on your way."
"Excellent prices, very easy to use website, interaction with (mobile) fitter was great. But, had to call customer services, and although there is callback, was sat on hold for nearly 30 minutes when the callback came."
Easy and quick to order my tyres and fitting by a local dealer was easy to book.
"Well done, on time and pleasant staff"
"Best deal in the area, brilliant service at stanways garage for fitting."
Very easy and efficient. Competitive price.
Good price and an effortless experience
Great prices for tyres - with a simple way to select/identify which ones to buy. The local (Chipping Norton) fitting garage was great and handy and did a super job whilst I waited.
Title says it all. Great service.
"Could have bought slightly cheaper elsewhere but choice of fitting garage was more convenient for me. Easy to order, delivered to chosen garage and fitted on date chosen. Simple."
"Fantastic price,value for money,not to impressed with the garage I chose this time,went for my appointment at 14.00,and they asked if I could go back tomorrow,said no eventually got my tyres fitted at 18.00,will use a different garage next time"
[REDACTED] has been my go to for three years now I would advise anyone to go. Best prices I can find and the greatest customer service. Visit the garage you plan to use first as occasionally they can be a let down but I’ve been lucky so far.
I've never used [REDACTED] in the past but I'm impressed with my first experience purchasing with them. The website is easy to use and picking the tyre I wanted was straight forward. The garage I used from their website was fantastic. I will be using [REDACTED] from now on.
Very good over all. We made around 10.00 saving in total.
"Great service, cheap, quick and easy"
Great prices on my Goodyear tyres from [REDACTED]. Large choice of garages to choose from to fit the tyres and I was in and out within the hour.
"Bought the tyres online, choose the garage I wanted. Sorted!! What more is there to say."
"Prompt, professional,friendly service ."
"Despite having to order my tyres the week before, I received notification the day before my appointment at 5:35pm that my tyres hadn’t been delivered & I’d need to rearrange for after the following Wednesday, which would have caused considerable issue due to an MoT. Also, the [REDACTED] offices close at 5:30 so there was no way to contact them to discuss. The next day, which was a Saturday & called around the open tyre places, starting with ATS where my original appointment was, & it turned out that my tyres HAD been delivered after all! But if I hadn’t contacted them directly I wouldn’t have known this. Despite emailing [REDACTED] to explain all this I still haven’t had any kind of contact from them to even offer an apology for the bad service.Needless to say, any potential savings are outweighed by the terrible customer service (wasn’t the first time I’d had problems with [REDACTED]) so I won’t be using them again"
"go online select the tyres you want and pay less, book tyres to be fitted at your tyre place of choice and time that easy does what it says on the tin."
"Excellent service, fast, friendly and efficient. Recommended."
An easy way to buy tyres a massive saving and ATS fit them for you cannot recommend [REDACTED] enough
"Pluses;PriceRange[REDACTED] keen to do well.Minuses;The fitting centres range from ambivalent to incompetant.Tyre pressures wrongly set,Handprints and tyre lube on my previously clean wheelsI had to buy tyres much earlier than I normally do thanks to a [REDACTED] purchase I made last year where the garage wrongly adjusted my tracking."
"Quite happy with my overall experience with [REDACTED]. Order, delivery and fitting were done pretty quick. Was a bit of a wait at the garage but job was done. Good service"
"Very efficient, within budget, excellent customer service and the garage used was also excellent. Got the date and time first requested for fitting. Will definitely use again."
"Excellent service. Not the cheapest but not far away. The centre used was exemplary, fast service."
I had my tyres done in Handforth . I got there about 20 minutes early and they were straight onto the job. Excellent service all round.
"When I realised I had ordered the incorrect tyres, I telephoned and the service I was given was helpful and polite and they very quickly changed the order and the correct tyres were delivered when they said. I was very pleased with the way they handled my call and I would certainly us them again."
Good polite and professional service from Richard Beavers in Minehead. Bit of confusion intitially over when the tyres could be fitted but everything worked out in the end.
Did what they said. Everything went like clockwork
Good price prompt service what more do you need
Delivered and fitted as arranged. No problems.
"The tyre selection was good, I was able to choose tyres that fitted my car and budget and then select the garage and time. I turned up at the garage , they fitted whilst i waited and 30 minutes later I was on my way with none of the crazy upselling and we'll get around to it later attitude of some tyre chains stores. Good company to do business with."
Would give 0 but wouldn't let me arranged for tyres to be fitted at mg local store on the day of my choice booked and paied got a email to call the customer service team as that garage couldn't do it on that day so rearranged for another day got to the garage on the arranged day only to be told that they hadn't been ordered in!
Cheapest of all online tyre sites and garage were really professional
"Very easy to use website , competitive pricing and tied in with a recommended tyre fitter within my area.Definitely use again, excellent process all the way through.Thanks"
First class service and very good price. I can recommend [REDACTED] and would use them again.
"I always order my tyres through [REDACTED].com; their website is so easy to use - either entering tyre profile or your car registration, and the available tyres for your car are organised by either price or brand, so if you're after something specific then you'll know easily and quickly if [REDACTED] can help.Everything about your order is organised seamlessly between [REDACTED] and the fitter you choose at the available slot you choose, so there's no ringing around and faffing around arranging appointments - just an email confirmation of your booking slot. Job Done!"
Excellent Service at Fort Street MotorsWere very accommodating when I needed to change the appointment at short notice. Friendly and informative.
Excellent service. Will use again.
"After having the lacquer on three of my wheels damaged by [REDACTED] fitters Solihull Vehicle Service, I was reluctant to use them again. Because of their prices, i decided to give them another try. This time I went with their fitters at Just Tyres, Hermitage Rd. Solihull, and what a difference. Proficient and friendly fitters, first class service and no damage to my wheels. Highly recommended."
"Excellent service price and fitting, I would use again"
An excellent way to buy tyres. None of the normal trash talk from the garage trying to buy other unnecessary services
Fantastic service will use always now
Amazing tyre. It’s black and rubbery.
Good price and service. Minimum waiting and the fitter is conveniently located.
A fast and easy way to get new tyres and great value too!
"Friendly staff, punctual appt and wheel balancing spot on."
Brilliant service ordered no problems garage of mmy choice time of appointment of my convenience and had the tyres fitted balanced and away in no time at all no problems from start to finish really appreciate the service and would recommend to anyone thank you
Great service easy to use very happy with it
good service and had no issues what so ever. Brought the budget tyres and they grip well but will have to see how long they last my last set of Continentals lasted 20k.
"Have used [REDACTED] before. Purchased 4 Avon tyres and also ticked the option to add wheel allignment at the time of the fitting. When I attended the garage. They didnt know anything about the wheel allignment, and didnt have time to do this. I have now had to return to the garage after work to get this done."
"Appointment fixed with local garage (1.5 miles away) Tyres and fitting paid for on-line.Day before appointment, email from BC asking me to phone them.Told that garage has the tyres but cannot fit them. BC would try to find another fitting garage and get back to me.Another garage was found which would fit the tyres at the original appointment time the next day, but it was 8 miles from my home and....I had to collect the tyres from my local garage and transport them in my car boot to the new garage the next day. This was achieved without problems and I received £20 refund on the tyres. (6%) for my trouble, which I was happy with. Not sure who the fault lies with but by giving 3 stars, it shaers the blame!"
"I ordered a Dunlop SP Sport Maxx 255/45 R17 W (98) tyre for my Mercedes on the [REDACTED] website. As usual, I took a screen-shot of the 'Order confirmation' screen showing these details for my records. Shortly afterwards I received an email confirmation from [REDACTED] which indicated that I had ordered a BMW Run-flat version of the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx. I rang to query this and although the sales person was very pleasant he seemed unable to accept that I had not ordered the BMW Run-flat version. Even after I emailed a copy of my screen-shot and then cancelled the order he still insisted that their ordering screen and systems are quite clear and that I must have accidentally ordered the wrong tyre. (Sub-text; another stupid customer!)I have since re-run my attempt to order this tyre and I suggest that [REDACTED] may benefit from re-designing their ordering screen and de-bugging their 'Order Confirmation' screen. After you enter a tyre number (AND the vehicle that the tyre is for!), the order-screen offers a number of boxes in rows of three which feature various brands of that tyre size. The large, headline text of these boxes are the brand and the price then the classified name of the tyre (in my case 'Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT' followed by some generic (and therefore worthless) 4 and 5-star reviews. Between the 5-star review and the price is a narrow ruled-off area with one or more unexplained icons and logos. All the offered brands seem to have a tiny black car icon, presumably to indicate to the totally confused among us that the tyres are for a car rather than a bicycle or an airplane. Some of the tyres then have various car logos - BMW, Mercedes, Ferrari etc as well as 'Run Flat', and MO. There is no explanation as to whether there is something special about the Dunlop SP Sport Maxx GT tyre with a BMW logo that makes it only suitable for a BMW, and how can that be anyway? And if it is, why do they offer it in response to an inquiry for a Mercedes tyre, which is one of the compulsory fields in the ordering screen? And if these symbols are critical to the correct ordering of a tyre specific to a particular vehicle then wouldn't it be sensible for them to be much larger and with their relevance explained?Then, having allowed customers to order a tyre specific to a particular vehicle, why doesn't the 'Order confirmation' screen include that fact? If I hadn't checked the confirmation email carefully I could have easily ended up with the wrong tyre on my car.So, if [REDACTED] want me to try them again they need to let me know that they have either amended these issues or explained why they don't need to."
excellent service from supplier- conors car centre - as always.
An efficient service; staff were courteous;no issues;
"Price was reasonable, convenient choice of garages and timings. Would definitely recommend."
"Perfect, very convenient and super quick service, would definitely recommend to family and friends."
Cheapest tyres on any brand And fit at a local tyre garage all inclusive.Highly recommended
"Quick and easy All booked online, went to a local garage who were very good I had just washed the car but not the wheel as the spare was on at the time I washed it They even washed the wheel before putting it back on with the new tyre Very happy"
"Bath Street Tyres very efficient fitter. The discount for buying via BC appears to have dropped a few points, although still worth the slight extra hassle at the moment. Tha ‘admin’ side of dealing with BC remains easy and well run. Overall, good product, efficient fit, no hassles. Job done."
"Great service! Guy went out of his way to be helpful, would use again without hesitation."
"Great service ,no hassle, so easy-to-use."
"Great site, easy to use, oder & book appointments. Have used [REDACTED] a few times & consistently high service and value for miney"
Good service but tyres did not arrive on the allotted day. I had to return the following day.
"Great service.,what more can I say."
Very easy to use and great local fitting
"Quick,easy and cheap"
Very convenient. Large choice of tyres. Unbeatable price. What is not to like?
"Great price, availability and service"
Great service and really good prices. Highly recommended!
Saved just over £40 compared to a drive in quote with a popular nationwide tyre fitter for one brand of tyre.
The [REDACTED] experience was good but the Premier trusted garage was poor. Booked in to have one tyre replaced and the wheel was already off of the car so they only had to take it out of the boot. This took them over and hour to change.
Very easy to access great choice and value. Appointed garage gave an excellent service with no extra charges.
Everything went as planned with excellent customer service.
Easy deal good value will definitely use again and the lads at ATS in Stroud were fantastic
As advertised and easy to use.
"Just one word sums it up for me excellent. The time and convenience of having my tyres fitted when and where i need them done is excellent,as sometimes life can be really busy,i have always had a top service from [REDACTED] and the tyre fitters they use and thats the reason i always use them and do not need to search or look anywhere else,and there prices are the best ive found."
Always cheapest price but service can be a bit hit and miss depending which garage you get sent to this Time it was ATS Waterloo Rd Manchester. Service was ok apart from wait time! My appointment was 12.00 Sat pm to change two tyres i was there early but still took until 1.15 to get sorted but a lot better than Formula1 auto 🤯 I won’t be going there again any time soon !!!
Superb would highly recommend definitely be going back to use again in the future
"The website, which I have used before - was great. On the day, the garage was not. I was using a different garage to usual, to be nearer my partner's home.She reported that the small garage in a quiet village gave veryy bad customer service. There was no sense of welcome or helpfullness. Indeed, the fitter grouched about her car type and said they were difficult and took over an hour to change two tyres. We shall not be returning to that place.I expect to use the website again but, if the next garage also fails - then that's it. The 4* rating is for the website NOT the garage. I am not going to name it here but will do so if asked."
Great to deal with. Excellent tyres for a brilliant price. Fitting at a time and place to suit.
"Great price, great fitting centre in Tadcaster"
"Ordering the tyres online and getting them delivered was absolutely fine and they would get 5 stars for this. However the issues I had with the garage (F1 Autocentres - Gloucester) after is the reason this gets a low star rating.I was originally booked in for a Saturday. I turn up, after getting a reminder of my booking via text I might add. The garage didn't have any fitters to do my tyres. They were sick. So I was a bit annoyed they couldn't have informed me before I left. But I don't blame them for people calling in sick. I was asked to come back on Sunday.So I turn up on Sunday @ 11am and since I didn't need the car I was happy to leave it there all day. Was told to come back at 4pm. I come back and they have not even started my car. I had to wait an hour for me car and the garage didn't do the tracking I had requested with it. The only positive, and why I gave 2 stars and not 1. Is they offered to do the tracking for free.Had to go back on Tuesday. I turn up on time as requested, but they are not ready, ask me to come back in 45 minutes. So I do that, have to wait around 30 minutes to get my car seen. At the end they only did the front tracking. So I had to go back again on Wednesday. This time I was seen within 20 minutes of arriving.But overall the service was not good. Having to go back 4 times just to have 2 tyres fitted and tracking. I will not be using that garage again. Unfortunately for [REDACTED], I am running out of garages to try with them and get a good service. So I might soon be looking to get my tyres elsewhere."
Good price and garage was great!
Great and fast service. Will use again.
"Easy, value for money, good service."
The purchase experience works very well - unless you choose the wrong tyre. Trying to get hold of Customer Service to even discuss the situation (and options) proved impossible.
"Excellent, quick and reliable service. Staff are patient, helpful and they ensure everything is ok before you leave. Will be using again for my next set of tyres"
Easy to order and too get the tyres fitted. Also got a discount buying 4 tyres
Excellent service as it always is. Great price.
The whole process from start to finish couldn't be more straight forward. The most difficult bit was working out the tyer sizes (which was a skill I now have for life). I have already recommend [REDACTED] to my friends ate work they were so good.I would use them again in a heartbeat
"excellent service, would use again"
"Great website, 100% use again and recommend aswell"
Competitively priced tyres fitted at a local first rate garage Tyreright of Gloucester.
"Great no worries, no stress"
"as easy as it gets to have new tyres fitted. Good price on the tyres we wanted, delivered direct to the garage of our choice and fitted at a booked time. You can’t get much easier, Recommended"
"great value for money and I have save just over £90, [REDACTED] even let you select ur fitting garage and time and date to suit your need. Very easy and convenient with excellent service."
Fantastic job done by all. Very helpful over the telephone and throughout.
Good service and good prices.
"Michelin fitted tyres at Bearsden. Hello, service great, ordering no bother, staff at garage (Scott) Bearsden very polite and helpful. Minded me from my first order just over a year ago.Will definitely use you system again!Francis Flynn"
"Good service, good price, the Garage I picked was spot on"
Great service and excellent price. Bought 2 Goodyear tyres to be fitted locally and all went very smoothly.
"Tyres delivered and professionally fitted at my favourite garage nearby within 48 hours of my order, which is excellent. This is my second set purchased from [REDACTED] and confirm the quality of their own selected brands was very good for the price on both occasions."
Quick and cheap
"Best price, very easy ordering process, short delivery time to fitting partner. Very pleased with overall experience."
"Great service, they had a supply issue with my original order and so upgraded to the next tyre up without charging the extra cost. Also they saw what could be an issue and highlighted it so that i could double check i had the correct order."
Used [REDACTED] to get my Audi Q5's complete set of replacement tyres. Initially selected the Michelin Latitude Sport 3's which sadly turned out not be in stock nearer the fit date. I was then promptly offered the Continental SportContact 5's (Audi OEM). Had the fitting at a local ATS Euromaster branch and staff were exceptionally professional & friendly and the job completed very quickly. I would definitely use BC again.
Great service and competitive prices.Very good local fitter too.
Good price and were able to adjust the fitting to my schedule
"Excellent service,did exactly what they promised..very happy will definitely use them again..Jay"
This is the third occasion I've used [REDACTED] and have to say the experience was effortless. I've got fed up spending £170 on tyres that wear out quickly or get non repairable punctures so decided to look at the budget tyre for my car.I purchased four for the price of two Original Continental tyres. And guess what the tread pattern is exactly the same as the Original tyres the noise rating and wet weather performance better. And my mpg has has increased from 37 to 40 mpg.The local home visit tyre fitter Gary was an excellent choice to.If you're local to Bedfordshire I highly recommended him too.
"Great service, takes the hassle out of finding a good variation of tyres to suit your budget also gives you a choice of recommended fitters."
"Excellent experience, local fitting at a great price!"
Very good quality and excellent service.
"Fast, efficient and cost effective."
"Everything went smoothly, will definitely use them again."
Excellent value. Quick service
remember to get cashback !
Great service. Great staff. Great price.
"From start to finish everything went smoothly, even when I went to the garage to get them fitted."
Good price and a friendly local garage.
Very fast good cheap tyres
Could not be easier - paid less than on the highstreet - booked Entire Automotive to fit at home. They texted half an hour before the allotted time and were very quick and helpful. Would recommend and will use again.
Great service so easy to book your tyres to get done
Good service and keen price!
Hassle free and well organised service. Used before and will definitely use again.
"Great service, Tyres were waiting at my chosen dealer and fitted straight away while we waited. Good service and good price."
"Tyres were perfect and arrived on time.The only slight downside was the waiting area in the fitting garage. It was described as a viewing area but there were only two small windows in it, one looking out onto the garage entrance and the other into a wall rack of tyres.This ensured that you could not see the fitter working on your vehicle."
"I would recommend to anybody,"
Good tyres close for fitting
Great experience found my tyres and local garage very quickly even managed to get a appointment within 2 days. Will defo use again 😁
"Easy to access the site, choice of tyres and straight forward booking, tyres fitted on nominated day, hassle free good price, will use them again."
Such an easy process to pick your tyres and fitting dates. Very reliable and great reminders and updates for the fitting day.I have found my new way to get tyres for both my cars.Thank you [REDACTED].
"Great price and easy process to book in. Paid the extra premium to have my tyres fitted at home. Communication was great, fitter turned up on time and did a great job. Really pleased, would certainly recommend."
"Great price and amazing service from Southport MOT who fitted the tyre, Chris and his guys always do a fantastic job"
Excellent Service & Simple
Overall a good service and good pricing. Fitter was a bit late but got in touch to confirm it was still ok to come.
Ordered tyres did not have car by time of fitting .Very helpful changed order to another one and saved me money. Used many times before and will be using again
"Good, quick service."
"I can, without hesitation recommend the service I received from both [REDACTED] and Invergordon tyre service. It has been a pleasure to do business with you both, and I have no reservations about return purchases."
"My 2nd time using [REDACTED]. Great service, great prices, was all very hassle free.Tyres seem good the steering much better.Would certainly reccomend them."
Very pleased with the speedy service and great service.
"Good service, great price, local garage"
"Ready at appointed time.Did good job in fitting tyres, not sure about accurac"
Great prices. A really easy buying experience with lots of options for having them fitted. I would highly recommend.
The staff were very helpful and friendly. The service was excellent.
1st class service. Great tyres and at a fantastic price.
Website really easy to use. Very quickly found the right tyre and location to have it fitted. Garage was a recommended [REDACTED] garage and I would definitely recommend them myself.
"Great service and great price, easy business from start to finish"
Very easy site to use. A great list of local garages for fitting and a great price too.
Fair prices. Smooth transactions and the garage was very helpful and efficient. Will definitely use again and will recommend.
Very good all seecice
"Great service, great tyres, would highly recommend!"
"Quick and easy to order online, hassle-free to get fitted and the staff are all nice at the Silverburn centre"
"Cannot fault it. Wide choice of tyres, best price, fitted locally on schedule."
Simply the best
Would have given a 10 but the tyre did not look new. Looked a bit old and dirty
"This is the second time that I have bought tyres through [REDACTED].com. The tyres were very competitively priced and the process of ordering was very straight forward. On both occasions the service was excellent. On this occasion I went to Hartley Garage in Ash Road, Longfield, Kent to have the tyre fitted. I had an appointment for 9am and they started work on the vehicle as soon as I arrived. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was a comfortable waiting area where I was offered tea or coffee. I only had to wait half an hour while the tyre was being fitted. I will definitely use them again."
"simple and effective, great service"
"I don‚Äôt have much spare time so used [REDACTED] as they already had good reviews and competitive pricing. The whole transaction was speedy and hassle free. I liked the fact that a local fitter attended to fit the tyres and offered a very efficient service. Will definitely come back again, no need to look elsewhere."
Great service hassle free easy to use.
"Excellent service,1st time user definitely order again."
Excellent all round. [REDACTED] was excellent and beat all other competition hands down price-wise. Booking a fitting date and time online was easy and worked in practice perfectly too with no unnecessary waiting at the fitting centre. The fitting centre provided excellent service too. The whole process of selection and purchase was really easy and quick. Very satisfied. Have used [REDACTED] before and will definitely use again without hesitation.
Very good and prompt service.
"Brilliant service, brilliant value"
good communication when had to change garage appointment
Fast service and great customer service
excellent service and a very good price
Competitively priced and fitted locally. Excellent service
Easy to use great service
"Very good price and quality tyres.Professional service too, Highly Recommended."
A Very quick effective economic service.
"Great service, even went to trouble of letting me know the tyres I had picked weren't suitable for my vehicle, and then sorted me out with a better alternative and refunded me the diference.Good communications, great tyres and good efficient fitting service.Thanks."
Bought 2 new tyres from [REDACTED] and had them fitted in Boxford garage Suffolk. Fantastic service from both and I will be back again for the next 2 soon. Brilliant price too. Thanks
The staff at AMS where absolutely fantastic
"Great service,easy to book"
Fitted Dunlop Sportmaxx RT2 98Y to my Giulia QV. Really good tyre choice as per the very useful reviews. They suit my needs as a day to day driver.The price beat everyone else by at least £60. I used the discount code displayed on the seller page and saved another £50. It was a win win situation for me. The fitting station was really good too. They did a great job.
"I do like [REDACTED] as a means of choosing tyres, the process was easy to follow and I felt it gave me an informed choice. On reflection the choice of garage might have been better, they were very busy and it took 2 hours to fit my tyres and adjust the tracking. Having had 4 new tyres fitted, after a long journey I had a tyre pressure warning light display and on checking, my tyres were all over inflated to 45psi, I had to deflate them to the recommended 32psi. The garage may have been busy but this was an oversight."
"Excellent tyre choices, good prices and choice of fitting garages."
"A very efficient & professional service, from ordering & booking the fitting to arriving at the fitting centre to have the tyres fitted."
Very good company excellent service from ordering to completion
excellent service and price at all times
"Good price, tyres fitted at agreed time. Would recommend."
There were quite reasonable price for my tires
"A very convenient service, and the guys in the garage I used were very helpful."
Excellent price and service - did exactly what was promised - can't fault the service or the communications from them - will definitely use them again
"Dead easy to get set up and new tires ordered. Great price, great tires, absolutely trouble free. and the Green Man Garage in Whetstone N20 are brilliant (they fitted the tires)!!Andy Fry"
Very good service. Easy to use . No problems
Absolutely ideal.
no waiting Fabulous price
"This was my first time trying [REDACTED].com. I was desperate to get some tyres for the next day after picking up a puncture on the Thursday and having a weekend trip leaving on the Friday night and it's amazing how hard it is to get decent sport tyres for the next day as no-one carries stock. I'd first tried making a booking with Kwik Fit mobile fittings, they rejected it halfway through the booking process but then charged me for it and it took a week to get my money back. The only other place I could find was [REDACTED].com - they were offering good sport tyres next day at a very reasonable price to be fitted at the local HiQ garage. It seemed too good to be true, HiQ themselves charged more money and couldn't do it till the next Tuesday yet [REDACTED] could get the tyres to them for the next day for a cheaper price. The reviews looked good so I took my chances and it was all smooth sailing. The appointment was first thing the next morning, tyres arrived no problem and by 10am the job was done. It does seem a very good service that puts the major tyre shops like National to shame who can only get tyres to their centres in 2-3 days, plus the price is very good, so I will certainly look to [REDACTED].com again in the future."
They had to change the date of fitting but still would recommend them
"Comprehensive range of brands at great prices, and easy to use. I used Wiltshire Tyres to fit mine, great service from these guys!"
Delivered when promised to a great local garage who fitted the tyre quickly and prices keen too. Cheers!
Very easy to order new tyres. Will do it again next time.
"Previous bad experience with [REDACTED] really ruined the handling of the car and only got the response of tough! !Despite their fitting agents testing the car and agreeing with me that the tyres recommend were rubbish. Had to buy 4 tyres instead of the 2 , I wanted. On this occasion every thing was fine. The agent even rang me early as I only wanted a tyre fitting to a loose wheel and got it fitted a day early."
"reat service super quick refund. By accident I ordered the wrong tyres to be sent to the garage - [REDACTED] refunded super-quick, no problems -great service"
"I have used [REDACTED] on a many occasions & always find them very professional. Excellent quality tyres at very competitive prices. So convenient to order online & have them fitted locally, all included in a fixed price. I used to shop around for tyres but now I know [REDACTED] can’t be beaten on quality or price."
Awful service. Don’t use. Still haven’t had my refund
Excellent service/ value for money from both [REDACTED] and partner garage
Great service and at a great price second time I’ve used them definitely use again
"Never had an issue with [REDACTED], or the tyre bought being fitted at ATS Euromaster."
good value & service
"Easy to use, great service."
"[REDACTED] is so simple to use, just need your reg and it does the rest. Local garages and a lot of them. Flexible payment options also."
"Easy to use, good prices and discounts and would recommend"
"The whole experience of ordering the tyres to the delivery was easy and pain free, would recommend them to anyone."
My first time using [REDACTED] and not the last!!! Very quick next day delivery and EXCELLENT prices. Great discount on 4 tyres too. Very highly recommended.I've saved over £200
Excellent service and advice by fitting team
Easy to do online. Reliable. At a time that‚Äôs convenient and good price.
"Product as described, quick delivery and the price is honest. I recommend it"
"Fast, efficient and value for money. Best price around for tyres I requested. Definately use again!"
"Easy to choose my tyres and book my slot. Great communication. Excellent customer service at the time of fitting. Will go back for sevicing, MOTs etc. Thank you."
"Ordered two Continentals for our VW Tiguan. Ordered on a Wednesday and was given a Friday appointment. Turned up on Friday and the tyres hadn't been delivered. [REDACTED] rearranged for the following Wednesday, but on the Tuesday they cancelled it and rearranged for Thursday then again to the Friday! Went through a few customer service employees who all said the tyres had been delivered and that the garage was at fault. We finally got someone who actually worked to get the problem sorted (Taylor). She got the tyres ordered on a next day delivery for us to finally get them fitted. She kept decent contact through out the time she dealt with it. Decent cost saving but was a hassle. The local fitter who fitted them was surprised and said he doesn't usually have trouble with [REDACTED] deliveries. Maybe we just got unlucky."
My first time using [REDACTED] & it saved me significant money and recommended a fitter which was very local. All went smoothly and I’ll use again
Could not be more easy great choice of tyres very competitive price and a local fitter
"Great service, had to change my appointment and BC customer service were accommodating and contacted the garage to make all arrangements for me!"
"Used [REDACTED] several times, they always deliver at a good price."
Hassle free great service
Good price and great service from the approved Tyre fitting company too !
"Used these a few times, shame my local tyre place didn't seem to be three this time but mission accomplished.Prefer to be able to see tyre info to compare before I buy that's why I use [REDACTED]"
"Booked the tyre, went Saturday morning to get it fitted to find the tyre wasn’t there. An email had been sent the previous day to say this but I hadn’t seen it. Had to cancel the order and buy from someone else."
Great price and fitting was easy to arrange with nearest fitter
"Great service at very competitive prices. This is the third time I have used [REDACTED], wouldn’t go anywhere else."
"[REDACTED] provide a broad choice of competitive options for purchasing tyres, via an easy to use website.I have had repeated good service from Alpha and Yapps Garage Cardiff, in supplying and fitting new tyres over recent years."
Good price and excellent service from local fitting station
"Tyre supplied by [REDACTED] and fitted by EdinTyre - superb prompt service at my office. All pressures adjusted & checked to my stringent requirements, perfect."
"Superb customer service . I ordered the wrong size tyre online and phoned up to change . Excellent customer service , swift and efficient service in cancelling and reorder and honoured the price . Definitely recommend .🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
Fast reliable service Days garage staff very polite and helpful
Had good selection of tyres across all price ranges so easy to pick what I was after
excellent service and fitting
"Great price, good communications from [REDACTED]. Garage chosen was excellent and professional."
Brilliant service even when I had to change garages.
"Smooth transaction, completely easy and plenty o choice to meet budget. Defintely recommend [REDACTED].com to anyone."
Great service and a good way to get good value and a good deal
Tyres supplied in a couple of days local garage service excellent as always
"Great choice, great value and superb fitters."
Best service highly recommended
Very poor arranging with garage to fix tyers
Bought budged tyres which is 97 pound no name on website garage fitted them on car they are radar r8 which is 67 pound totaly ripped of for 4 set not recomended unless they put name on website budged ones
Excellent service with great prices and fitted at a reliable centre with no problems
"Online order was very easy to handle, and felt more informed about which tyres I was purchasing than when I go into a garage.The garage I used were friendly and accommodating and called me to let me know when finished."
"Everything worked perfectly, job completed in 2 working days from order."
Great service and good tyres at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.
"Excellent service, my husband has just had his car fitted with them, I had my car fitted a couple of years ago, sold the car last year , bought a 2016 Yaris which needs new types, so it’s back to [REDACTED]. Thanks to you and the really friendly garage that fitted them."
"Easy, efficient booking system. Recommended garage was indeed of very good quality and good customer service. Overall we were very happy."
"Good price, efficient service and the fitting garage took due care of the alloy wheels."
Top notch - Worked perfectly and got a better selection at a cheaper price than at the garage where it was fitted!!
I’m still wondering how 3tyres turned up the next day and the 4th tyre took 4 after maybe you had to make it because every one I spoke to to ask where it’s gone told me it will be there the next day or it’s on it way so my customer came in asking is it in yet and 3 times I told him it will be here soon ‘it on it’s way” the third day I had to give him a car to use because guess what it will be here at 12 o’clock and guess what it turned up 3 o’clock I would suggest you have a staff meeting and tell them not to tell customers it’s on it way when they no it isn’t
Good price - good fitting experience - mr tyre Redditch
Possibility to buy on credit. Good low tire prices. Professional service at the tire exchange point. Simple website support.
Best price online for the tyres ...Got to choose a garage that suited my needs ...10 out of 10 ... I will be using this service again
Excellent service! Good and quick booking system. Good price !I would recommend it
"Amazing service, really quick."
Very happy with the service I received
excellent service from beginning to end
No problems with booking or timing. Extra mot booked also.
ended up getting a refund but process was very easy
Excellent choice of tyres and a fast and friendly service
Good prices and very easy to book a fitting!
"First time user of [REDACTED] and well pleased.Good price, good service but slight question over a special offer tainted my opinion slightly."
Easy to order and arrange fitting. Date to suit which was helpful. Tyres are brilliant and very good price for them
Second time I have used [REDACTED] and I found the website to be very good and easy to use and navigate.
"Seemed good value for 4 Avon ZX7 fitted. First garage was closed when I got there but [REDACTED] quickly sorted an alternative at Bathwick Tyres on Coity Road, Bridgend and they were spot on. Very thorough and pretty swift. Overall fairly happy after a bit of a false start!"
the best company I have used
Tyres took a week. Most inconvenient
Great tyres at great prices.Slightly disappointed at the fitting time by ATS Ripon. Appointment was for 11am for just one tyre......More than an hour before fitting was completed !
"Easy to book, very friendly and competent service at garage that fitted my new tyres, best price I could find"
"In my opinion, [REDACTED] have revolutionised the industry. No more turning up at some drafty tyre bay to negotiate a price. Sit and choose in the comfort of your own home. Choose a tyre to fit your budget. Choose a fitting date and time. Turn up and get tyres fitted. What is there not to like?"
"told fitting was on a thursday, but told have to wait till following tuesday wasnt happy at all regards patrick bailey"
"Straight forward buying experience, choice with customer reviews to make purchasing easy. Quality products, easy to order and arrange local fitting. Complete package, why go any where else...."
"Consumer friendly, hassle-free service. Ordering procedure very straightforward and easy to use. Only gave 4 stars because my original date of fitting was changed due to a delay in delivery of my tyres. Overall, a great service at good prices."
First time using [REDACTED]. Got recommended by a few friends. So easy will use again. Shame the garage I picked were c**p
"They have a good selection of tyres, from budget to performance, their prices are very competitive and their fitting centres are excellent, honest and do not try to push any unnecessary services on you like some, very satisfied."
Very good price and excellent service at ATS lowestoft. I would highly recommend buying any tyres from here. The best price and the better selection available than anywhere else. I couldn't get cross climates in my size anywhere and from you guys they were cheaper than others offering me continentals which only lasted 10k
Best value out there! Will recommend to all my friends!
Really quick delivery. Great price. All the right info up front. Will defo use again. Thanks
Easy to use website. I had to amend my order last minute and customer services helped me out very efficiently. I’m so impressed! Will certainly use them again.
Well designed website made ordering tyres easy. Needed to put actual tyre sizes in because using registration number gave the wrong profile (same happens on all tyre websites !). Car is an Octavia Scout.Have used this (Grahams at Halfway) fitter before and service was as good as usual.Altogether a very easy (and cheap - just caught a 10% discount on these tyres) way of buying tyres.
"Easy, helpful service.....and competitive prices."
I find using [REDACTED] great and easy. Would highly reccomend
Buying the tyres and arranging fitting worked well. I had to wait up to an hour for fitting as the tyre retailer was understaffed. My request for checking tracking hadn't reached the retailer so this wasn't done. Apart from that the tyres were fitted without other problems and the cost was much lower than elsewhere.
Brilliant service and the finance available was very helpful. Thank you. Will definitely use again.
"great service, it's easy, book your appointment, in 30 minutes it's all done"
"great price, quick and convenient fitted at a garage less than 2 miles away , delighted will use again"
"After a mixup which was my fault the resolution involved contacting via phone, lines were always busy but a callback service worked well just needed to wait around. The result was what I wanted with decent tyres fitted no issues for the winter."
Great Service and value for money.
Really quick and courteous service my car was ready exactly when they said it would be
It’s the best service I have ever had when comes to buying tyres thanks
"Quick, simple and easy to select your tyres, with clear information in regards to the ratings. Booking the fitting appointment is just as quick showing all available times. Would highly recommend!"
First time using [REDACTED]..very smooth service. Fitted at Tudor cars in Barrow with tracking. Top notch!
"great service with local garages being able to get used , i will use this service again no worries"
"Really good service, timely and efficient"
"GREAT DEALTried to buy a set of 4 premium tyres local, what a joke. still waiting for them to get back to me.The only negative the fitter could have cleaned his mess off my brand new alloy wheels.I would use [REDACTED].COM again"
Excellent service. Hassle free experience. Would highly recommend.
"Quality Choice Tires - As usual the process if buying the tires and booking fitting was simple and straight forward. Tires fitted at my local ATS service centre. Bought ""Quality Choice 255/50 R20"" which turned out to be Dimax-R8+ tires, a brand I've not come across before. First appearance they seem to be of decent quality and look good on the car. Did some research and they get a good rating elsewhere, and very pleased with the price compared to the premium brands. If the durability is as good, I've found my new tires!"
Nice and easy to order which helps also the garage where the tyres are fitted are friendly and helpful
"Have used them a few times now, so quick and easy and my tyres were fitted within 20 minutes on the day! Brilliant service"
"Great service, fantastic local garage and tyre arrived promptly. Always consistently the best price. Highly recommended."
"Excellent service fitting, great prices, easy to use website. Perfect"
"Excellent, can't fault the service"
Great service but not to time.
"Excellent service, will definitely use again"
Easy to use service and top prices on tyres .
Reliable and value for money. The local garage was extremely professional and friendly
Excellent prices and service from a local garage
"I chose [REDACTED] for convenience, price and locality"
"Easy to use, booked in for fitting on next day at local dealer. 50% saving on tyre cost from same dealer. Highly recommend"
I have used [REDACTED].com several times now and I find it very easy to select and order my tyres and arrange a fitting appointment using the website. The prices are extremely competitive and my local tyre fitter is excellent.
Easy to use. Good price and booking system works very well.
Brilliant and exceptional.
Excellent price and good communication regarding tyre suitability for my car
"Fast, efficient, delivery and fitting, brilliant, good value for money, very pleased with the exceptional service. Will definitely use again."
Tyres fitted ok but not balanced correctly so having to get them re done elsewhere
"Very easy website to use, email confirmation of the tyres arrival at my chosen fitters. Turned up and had them fitted, no problem. Would use again."
Good price and the system works well
"Tyres supplied and fitted on time as ordered, absolutely no complaints"
So easy to order and fitted at a time to suit you with at a local garage Defiantly use again
Extremely fast next day delivery. I bought 4 Michelin winter tyres of them they were by far the cheapest. I will definitely use them again
"Quick, easy and all at a good price! I have been using [REDACTED] for the last eight years or so now. I can’t fault them. Excellent!"
Very clear information and good communication. ATS was very thorough and helped with getting a brake issue sorted.
Good value. Fitting process worked smoothly.
Really easy to do ... great savings....
Competitive price and great service. Allows you to search for your favourite tyres.. Not what a fast fit tell you. Can recommend without hesitation.
"[REDACTED] price excellent, directed to local, non-franchise tyre fitter, courteous, quick and polite service."
Very good experience with [REDACTED] after buying 2 Michelin tyres and fit them free of charge in one of the garages.
"Always find the price really good, unfortunately this time they cancelled my appointment the day before I was due to go. It caused a bit of an issue, and had to be rescheduled 3 days later due to the tyres not being delivered on time. I have used a number of times before, and will do again, but the customer service on this occasion was well below expectations."
fitter arrived on time got stuck in straightaway soon finished very pleased
"Ease of use, right products at the best price"
Good tires. Happy with the purchase
The supplier made a mistake and delivered the wrong tyre. I had to contact them to order another tyre and arrange another appointment.
No better circle to experience/bravo
Efficient service and great price
A great range of tyres available to suit all budgets. Quick and simple with helpful online chat support. Ordered to be fitted locally. No problems.
Quick turnaround & availabilty
"3rd time I've used [REDACTED], can't fault them. Brilliant service along with ATS, my choice for fitting them."
Very good service from start to finish. Will use again.
Great service. Dropped the car off went back about 30 minutes later all done. So much easier organising your tyres online then you can pick where to get them done. I would definitely recommend
"Excellent service, tyre done at home in 10 mins, woukd definitely use again"
Excellent service throughout!Tyres delivered quickly to the local fitter!Local fitter Howard Selby was first class and accommodated at time requested.Super experience 👍
EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY WILL DEFINITELY USE AGAIN
Great price drove to fitting station went for a coffee came back job done.easy.
"all brill, good price, good fitting"
Reasonable price with a Discount
"Great service, easy process"
"Simple. Ordered tyres. Good price. Selected where to be fitted, date and time. Turned up. Left car, went and had a coffee. came back and all done. What could be simpler?"
"I had shopped around for some tyres for my car and [REDACTED] are a similar price to that of a few other companies, however I thought I would give them a go on the basis I can order online and have them fitted at home or work making it much easier. It’s far from easy however. I had booked for a mobile fitter to come out to me (had to pay a surcharge for this of £6) on a Saturday which at that point was a week away, I selected a pm slot. No details were given not any confirmation as to when pm is other than after 12. I waited in all afternoon then the garage called me around 3pm and stated [REDACTED] had delivered 2 different tyres and therefore could no longer fit them. I called [REDACTED] and was on hold for 10mins before someone eventually admired the mistake. They apologised and said I would get some compensation and would arrive in 3/5 days. The tyres have since been fitted and 2 weeks on the compensation has not arrived. I try calling and always on hold for ages. The idea is great but the customer service is awful."
Competitively priced tyres fitted local to home - faultless service.
"It’s easy to compare a huge range of options, select the tyres you need and then arrange for fitting at a convenient time and place."
"Great company to do business with, made everything very easy, they even find you local garage to do the work and great prices as well ..."
Great realisable service .
"Prices are very competitive, ordering is fast & fitting location staff friendly & knowledgeable. No pushy up selling.I have bought tyres several times in the past from [REDACTED] & won't be buying from anywhere else in the future."
Quick and easy to order
Great service very please easy website use thank you
"Great service as always, quick and easy to book an appointment."
Very happy to state that this was the best and easiest purchase of tyres in my motoring time.
Best price we could find and we were able to get the tyre fitted locally very quickly. We received excellent friendly efficient service.
I had an issue with the garage who fitted my new tyres but both [REDACTED] and the garage (Lavender Motors) were first class. The minor problem was quickly solved and the willingness of both parties was very reassuring.Thanks all.
So easy and quick to use. No hassles at all
"Fast, easy, no problems at all"
"Great price, great choice of local garages"
"Great experience! The lads were efficient, friendly and very helpful!"
"Once again very pleased, excellent service and best price by far."
"Service,Tun Up"
No problems encountered.
Excellent Value / Price with no hassle
Great fast service .. experienced fitters .. cannot fault .. highly recommended .. 5*
ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST PRICES ON QUALITY TYRES. FITTED AT NEAREST DEALER TO SUIT YOU. PERFECT!
Great service recommended. Great service recommend
"Good Choice,good price and Castle motors excellent for fitting"
1st time using [REDACTED]. All correspondence great. Had tyres fitted in a local garage i never knew existed. All quick and efficient with a friendly service.
Absolutely spot on. Very friendly bunch of guys with good attitudes and eager to help. Very impressed.
"Good prompt on line service, good price, quality tyres, good garage recommended and delivered the items direct to the fitting garage"
Cracking price (10% off offer on Michelins day) & garage did a good job although took a lot longer than i'd envisaged.
"Excellent fast service, couldn’t fault ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Top make tyres at good prices supplied and fitted promptly, first class will be buying from them again."
Quick simple and affordable nothing else to say but perfect 👍🏻👍🏻
Very good condition and very good value and very good service
hassle free service tyres fitted locally. Price was very reasonable for a quality tyre and included fitting and wheel balancing
"Good value, easy to arrange. Great concept"
Fast and efficient service. Highly recommended.
Just great! Every simple process
East to order and very competitive pricing Quick and efficient service. 2 tyres fitted in 20 minutes. Would definitely use again. Only small gripe would be the waiting room which was not a very nice place to be although fully aware I'm in a garage!
"Very quick and easy to use. Bonus, it was my own garage that fitted them. They even wrapped up my winter tyres.! Goodcommunication too. Recommended."
"Excellent service, great customer service and quick response. Would recommend to everyone.Very switched on company"
"Excellent service from [REDACTED] as usual. Good value, and trouble free too. Thank you."
Slow response to discount code. Had difficulty in using a code previously given to me and it took 10 days to respond by e-mail
This company was recommended to me by a friend and I found it really good . I was able to select the tyres that were suitable for my car while also following guidance provided. There is a wide range of tyres to choose from and the fact that one can select the nearest place to have the tyres fitted at their own convenient time makes this service excellent!!
Only thing was for this type of tyre it seems I had to go to ATS in Farncombe but just for convenience I might have preferred Peugeot on Hurtmore Road-service at ATS was great but I prefer the facilities whilst waiting at Peugeot! 😊
"I have purchased tyres for a variety of domestic vehicles from [REDACTED] for some years. The website is informative and helpful, the range of tyres for each size is comprehensive, from budget to high performance, and there's a wide range of prices at market-leading rates. The ""order now and agree a fitting appointment in a few days' time, at your preferred centre"" usually works well. Only once was delivery of my order delayed: [REDACTED] staff investigated promptly and re-arranged the appointment, while further-discounting my bill in compensation for my inconvenience. Can't say fairer than that."
Always the first place I go to for replacement tyres for either the car or bike - cuts out the hassle of buying tyres and then having to arrange fitting them separately.
"Prompt service, with good choice of local garages"
I purchased 4 tyres to replace my 4 winter tyres. The online ordering system worked smoothly and I received a swift confirmation of an appointment on my chosen date with my preferred garage. All my tyres were changed and balanced competently by The Dent Centre in Glasgow. I would not hesitate to recommend [REDACTED] if you're thinking of purchasing new tyres.
"Competitive price and choice of options. Fitting location seemed to have conflicting information about booking but tried to meet expectations, I got the impression this wasn’t the first time it had happened."
Hassle free booking from home.Good price.Fitted in good time on the date required.
"Great selection of tyres, good website makes it easier to choose and nice prices too."
"Great service, prompt delivery but price could have been better."
"After I placed my order, paid, and accepted a fitting slot, I was contacted by [REDACTED] and told that my fitting slot was being cancelled, because they were unable to deliver the tyres due to the weather.The weather in question had been forecast over a week in advance, and before I placed my order. Other businesses prepared and adapted, [REDACTED] did not. They could have chosen to deliver the tyres to the fitting centre before the weather came, they had time to do this. Alternatively, they could have set their website not to accept fitting slots in the days immediately after the poor weather. They did neither of these things.When I eventually got my tyres fitted, the local garage that did the work were great. Very friendly and helpful. I'm going to leave them a positive review elsewhere so that they're not tarnished by this one."
"Easy, reliable process. Only went with [REDACTED] originally as I wanted certain tyres. The place where I had them fitted, could not supply and offered me something else. So I had the tyres I wanted fitted at the same place I normally go to, got the tyres “I” wanted for £40 less than I had been quoted by another garage."
This is the first time I have used [REDACTED] and I am impressed. I brought 2 Bridgestone tyres and they were £20 cheaper than if I brought them direct from my local tyre shop. The tyres were fitted at my local tyre shop and they said there was no way they could match the price. I put the money I saved towards having my wheel alignment done. Happy days! Will definitely use again and would recommend to friends and family.
[REDACTED] is an easy to use website with great range of tyres at very reasonable prices couple that with excellent customer service from Elsham garage the Premier fitting partner where my tyres were fitted and you have a great overall package. I will always come to [REDACTED].com for my tyres.
"I always use [REDACTED], best prices"
"Excellent service. Easy to find right tyres, easy to book fitting with local garage who were quick and efficient all at an excellent cost."
So easy to order tyres and at a good price. I was able to choose the Company to fit the tyres and at a time which suited me. Will recommend and use again.
I’ve used [REDACTED] for a few years now and I always get my tyres fitted when I want to not when the garage says they can fit me in. I always save on local prices but still get them fitted by quality fitters!! Fabulous!! I always recommend [REDACTED].com when discussing tyres with mates. Every friend I’ve recommended has saved money!!
Good. Easy to use system
"I ordered 2 front tyres, I wanted them fitted at my nearest garage, unfortunately the garage couldn’t accommodate my date so I phoned [REDACTED] and changed the garage with ease, there was great communication and I was kept informed by various emails. Would definitely use them again"
"Excellent supplier For an online tyre supply and fitting service [REDACTED] are brilliant , A totally hassle free superfast service with a large network of fitters , I would recommend highly"
"Easy to use online,great deal good price,no problems.will be my no 1 tyre supplier from now on."
Very good.. delivery if tyres to garage on time
"Bought the tyres, booked the appointment at a service centre, and the tyres were fitted as expected.The whole process was nice and smooth, and how and when things would happen were explained at every stage.[REDACTED] took the stress and bother out of getting new tyres fitted to my car!"
The time you book is apparently not the actual time you are offered so you have to replan the next day when they actually confirm your time. Not sure why you would not just be honest from the start?
I was delighted with the service. I made a mistake of ordering the wrong size tyres originally but the person on the customer service was very good natured and rectified the situation with no fuss at all. I will have no hesitation in using [REDACTED] again in the future.
Easy to use service which is good value for money compared to the high street.However the discount code allocated to the tires i chose did not work at checkout so losing out on a £20 saving
"Great service, choice and price"
Terrible customer service. Got a refund in the end and bought the tyres from a garage
Appointment was on time and customer service was very friendly
Tyres and [REDACTED] service and price was good . I didn't have confidence with the fitters. I asked them to torque the wheel bolts to 170NM. They said this was too tight but I insisted. I then watched them do the bolts up with an 'air gun' then apply the torque wrench to each bolt on each wheel but didn't see the wrench move before the toque (click) setting engaged suggesting that the 'air gun' had already done them up super tight. This is all well and good until I need to change a wheel at the side of the road and can't get the bolts undone without a breaker bar.
Looked online for required tyres. Good choice of tyres varying prices to suit budget. Quick and easy booking service. Fitted at exact time. No wasted time waiting. Thank you. 2nd time used [REDACTED] as well. Highly recommend
"They are so easy to use ,you get to choose which tyres at the cost you can afford with reviews on all the tyres great üëç"
No problems. No queues. Booked a time right for me.
"Great service again, so easy to use and book and best prices too. We use a local garage to work so drop the car off first, then pick it up when done."
"Quick and easy,good prices and garage service very professional"
"So easy to use, brilliant service"
"Prices are the cheapest, the use of the online booking system is easy if you simply want a replacement tyre like for like. Simply read off the side of the old tyre the descriptive sizing and input. Choose a local fitting service listed and select the time and date of appointment, what could be easier. Great service."
I found tyres are cheaper compare to Asda tyre.
Really easy to complete
Used before good service an value for money can’t fault them
"Perfect, brilliant price, easy to locate someone to fit and quick delivery"
"Great work! Cheapest tires around, simple, easy, clear winner!"
"Got the tires I wanted at a competitive price. Also got a few extras from the garage for free - wheel alignment checks and front brakes checked.What wasn't so good was [REDACTED] tried to contact me to state that I needed Run Flats. I tried to call them back but lines closed early. Then emailed them and although they came back to me they didn't read or take notice of my out of office.Therefore ended up turning up at the garage and just put on the tires that I had already bought. They also created a little unnecessary distress as it was made out that I couldn't apply non-run flats, the garage said it was all ok and tires now fitted.So all good in the end, just unnecessary distress in the middle!"
Quick and easy to use and good value. Tyre fitters booked via the website were good too.
"Excellent service from [REDACTED] and their network of fitters.I ordered a tyre online and it was delivered to Reliance Auto Test in Bicester, who gave me a fitting appointment time.Turned up on time, sat in reception for 10 minutes whilst the tyre was changed and drove away !! Brilliant service !!"
"Very good overall experience, polite and helpful staff.Arrived promptly around 9:10am and did choose to sit and wait in the waiting area. Complimentary drinks hot and cold were available. After waiting an hour I thought it must be nearly done as it was only one tyre being replaced, 10:30 my car was finished.When I went out they had cleaned the outside and hoovered the carpets inside as well. This I wasn’t expecting so couldn’t fault the extra work they put in."
[REDACTED] service is great. No issues with their service the number of times I have used them.Tyres always been delivered on time and fitting center already ready.I have just had an issue with the last pair of tyres fitted.Tyres fitter has damaged my show wheels and left a gouge in the face of them.
[REDACTED] was so easy and the garage that fitted the tyres were really efficient
"Excellent, user friendly website, providing key info at a glance"
Fast service order placed Monday arrived Wed as I live on the West coast of Scotland happily surprised
Quick and easy. Highly recommended.
Competitively priced
"[REDACTED] have continued to impress me, this time seemed to be even easier! The tyre choices were comprehensive and competitive while the chosen installer could not be more helpful.I will us them again for sure."
Very easy to book and reasonably priced.
Excellent - such a great service
Always great service and best prices
"Easy to use site, easy to find a suitable product at a competitive price and a speedy delivery."
"Very easy to use ,stick reg in ,buy select tyres selection fitting station, pick time to suit your needs, done brilliant"
Quick and done properly
"good price arrived at fitting garage promptly but unfortunately the garage concerned over inflated the tyres by 15psi and did not apologise when I picked it up via tyre pressure monitor on car also they broke tabs on gear stick gear insert ,possibly by hitting it in temper but did not mention it to them as I didn’t find it till I drove down the road and couldn’t prove they did it anyway I have only praise for [REDACTED] but when I next need tyres I will still buy off them but pick another garage to fit ,fortunately there are other garages locally"
Tyres at a good price would gladly do business with again
Great value for money great people to do business with
Excellent. Tyres ordered an fitted to suit me at my local tyre outlet .quick service from them. Just made this a dream to use.I did think i was gonna have issues but 5* service. Couldn't ask for anythin better.And they worked out cheaper than buying from any other tyre outlets i could find.
"Have used [REDACTED] many times and been very happy with them until this time, ordered 4 tyres but when went to have fitted they had sent only 3 tyres and not told me, so consequently had to make a return journey to garage when the fourth tyre was sent three days later. So on thisoccasion very poor service by [REDACTED]."
easy to use
"Good value & easy to arrange, second time I’ve used [REDACTED] and will not be the last."
Easy to choose and simple to buy. That’s it!
Excellent price and excellent service.
"Great service, from the website to the fitting! If you want quality tyres at a good price, use this company!"
"Straightforward, cost-effective and the mechanic at Glasgow Silverburn was excellent. Unlike many national chains, you are not conned out of extra work, you simply have the tyres you pre-selected fitted to your car within 30mins."
"Excellent. Pick your car-car tyres-select garage-book time-pay-turn up-done. No extras, all in. great price."
Quick and easy instructions to follow will use them again
Very impressed Came on time and fitted the 2 tyres quickly
Best priced and fitted local. Just the job
"Great price for tyres, well organised and efficient fitting - definitely will use again."
"[REDACTED] customer services are very unhelpful, very un knowledgable and when asking questions which are not displayed on the webpage staff are not trained sufficiently enough to answer a customers query. However the garage which I had my tyres changed at were absolutely excellent."
Always a pleasure
"First time using online tyre company and couldn't have been better. Easy to navigate, plenty of choice and information on the tyres and the fitting centre (AMS Moulton Park, Northampton) were also a pleasure to deal with."
good price on tyres
..................................
Easy to order (have your tyre details)Easy to payBy far the CheapestEfficient fittingWhat more do you need?
"Purchased 4 Michelin Crossclimate tyres for my wife's Mazda CX5. Online showed £130 each less 10% which should have been £468 but billed for £473.76? but no complaints. Fitting at local garage (Cumming Automotive, Glasgow) which just happened to be the garage where I get the car serviced, which I would recommend to anyone. Whole process worked smoothly. First time using [REDACTED], but would definitely use again"
"This is the second time I have used [REDACTED], and both times have been an excellent experience from start to finish. Premium tyres at the best price, fitted locally. Nothing more to add."
Good range of tyre brands. Easy to understand tyre specifications. Trusted local fitting.
After initial problems with the allocated garage stating that my tyres had not been delivered and no booking for fitting a quick phone call to [REDACTED] and the problems were solved within ten minutes of my original phone call l would recommend [REDACTED] to any of friends and family wishing to purchase tyres
I had two quality Dunlop tyres fitted to my Mazda 6 at ATS Redruth. The price was £303 for the two tyres which was over £100 less than any other source that I could find.I use [REDACTED] for all our 4 cars in my family as they supply identical tyres to other sources at large discounts. ATS fit all my tyres for BC and they offer a brilliant service and take great care of your car and expensive alloys. They also never keep me waiting on pre-booked appointments.Brilliant service from BC.
"No Hassle, Excellent Service."
Very helpful and good customer service I was well pleased
Easy and efficient service.
Good value tyres. Fitting was exceptional at my local tyre service. I will continue to use this service.
Good place to compare and contrast tyre products and prices in the comfort of your own home. Also to select preferred fitter rather than be dictated to. All in all a no fuss service.
Tyres hadn‚Äôt arrived at the fitting station. Had to return the following day.
used you before very good tyres very prompt fitting thank you.
"simple, quick and easy !"
Caravan tyre purchased and its almost 18 months old already
My tyres were fitted speedily.. I would buy again from [REDACTED]
"Great product, Protyre Preston who fitted them are also 5 star"
Arrived unexpectedly early and tyres were changed straight away. This is the advantage of dealing with an enterprising local business. Very easy to order tyres and the price was competitive. Altogether a pleasant experience.
"I could not find cheaper tyres at that quality, easy system. Will definitely use again!!"
It’s a very easy process to buy tyres from [REDACTED] .... You are given a wide choice at really good prices and are guided to where they can be put on your car and an appointment set up . There are no hidden charges ... it really is good .
Easy to use. Problem free purchases.
"Friendly, reliable, on time, helpfu, efficient l, good communication, good value"
"Where do I start... I have used [REDACTED] for years and never had an issue, however that isn’t the case now. I initially booked a mobile fitting service, who damaged my locking wheel but and so couldn’t proceed, had to then travel to a garage to have fitted, which seemed fine, until I noticed one of the tyres was the wrong size. Called and emailed numerous times, and was hit and miss as to whether I got any response. Ended up using PayPal’s escalation process, who refunded me one of the tyres as they also never received a response. Rebooked from scratch with a weeks notice to get fitted, only to now be told at 17:30 day before that there had been a supply issue, and therefore need to rearrange for a weeks time. Still driving around with an illegal tyre a month on! Absolute joke, and customer service non existent"
"Great value, great prices ease of site and choice of convenient fitters"
"Very easy to use. Good value for money. No fuss. I entered in the tyre details, got a range of options with various pros and cons, chose the tyres, chose the location, finished. Third time I've used them. Always been happy."
Excellenttttttttttttttytt
All went to plan excellent all round experience
"Easy to book through,"
"It really couldn't have been easier, the bit that took the longest was deciding what make of tyres to for. Once I made my mind up the rest was straight forward, pick a garage that's convenient to you and when you want them fitted. Pay and it's all done."
I was very pleased with the service that I received from [REDACTED] and the price was very competitive.
Seamles service..... And communication
Very happy with the service and product. All completed as planned . 10% discount a huge lever in making the decision to purchase
"More than happy with the efficiency of ordering on line and the tyres getting to the garage of my choice. However the offer of entering into a competition to win £100 of Asda vouchers was a definite mistake. I have been inundated with calls from various companies trying to flog me broadband to lottery tickets. I was told I had actually won the Asda vouchers, but he continued trying to sell me the lottery. My advice therefore is to avoid doing any competition."
Great service. Pretty good price too!
"So easy, it's all there on one page, your choice of tyres, costs, garages, everything. You just click and they do the rest. Great!"
"[REDACTED] were efficient & courteous, however, 3 things let them down.1. The original date that was booked had to be changed2. The original tyre that I chose from the website had an incorrect speed rating for my car (should have been Y but website showed X).3. The quality of the garage that carried out the tyre change was a poorly run (back street type) garage where the housekeeping within was so poor that it was bordering on a dangerous environment to work in."
"Ordered 2 tyres to be fitted in time for Mot. Arranged work around the appointment. The evening prior I received a text and email stating the tyres were not available and my date had been changed to 2 days later.Called the help line and was given no apology or real reason, other than the tyres could not be sourced on time.After a lengthy discussion explaining the inconvenience they reluctantly offered a £15 refund.Tyres fitted and all ok."
"Great service, ordered and quickly delivered to Victoria Garage, Richmond, efficiently fitted while we waited - excellent service from both supplier and garage - thank you"
Fast and efficient. Definately use again.
"Great service, price and you listed my favourite fitters ATS in my local area .. can’t fault any off their service throughout. Thanks"
"AC Tyres & exhausts is a small garage with a father and son pair that excels in their work. I have been to large tyre outlets in the past but the service and work ethic that AC Tyres gave was exceptional, and they even took time out of their busy schedule to talk to me, and make sure I was a satisfied customer. They deserve the 5 star rating and I will be going back to them again, and tell others about the standard they gave."
Excellent. Very easy to do the online purchase and the booking appointment with local tyre fitter. Good communications throughout the whole process aswell. Will be using again when the need for tyres arises again.
Seamless booking and fitting execution.
All ok with everything. Used before and will use again. ***** stars.
"Very impressed,opted to pay extra to have tomatoe tyres come out and fit,phone call on day if choice,swapped tyres at my workplace,saved my time waiting in a garage,approx 25 % cheaper than going to garage"
"Excellent service, prompt and professional nothing negative to say....brilliant."
"Easy to navigate the app, realistic tyre prices. First class service."
Best price I could find for the tyres I wanted after shopping around and fitting arranged as quickly as anywhere else could.
Very easy to use web site with plenty of choice of tyres.
"We ordered 4 winter tyres and had three delivered (only useful if you have a Reliant Robin). This is the second time that tyres were not available in this country. They could not locate a fourth tyre. Consequently, it took an hour and a half on the phone and eventually we had to re-order a different set of tyres and return the three tyres to a local garage (as they mucked up the collection of the other tyres) and at one point we had seven new tyres in our hallway (A smelly nuisance!)The phone operatives are very helpful, but this company needs to sort out it’s delivery. If the tyres are not in stock don’t take payment and certainly don’t deliver part of an order."
Very poor service from the fitting centre.[REDACTED] should vet more carefully.
Fast and brilliant service definitely be using [REDACTED] again..
"Quick, convenient and reasonably priced"
"First time using [REDACTED] and it was a pleasure. Had just bought a spare wheel which needed a tyre. I didn't want to pay the normal price as I had just had to buy one.The [REDACTED] Web site was easy to use and gave the option of a few budget tyres. I shose the cheapest as it is only a spare and ordered it having chisel one of their premier fitters. The fitting time came through which was not convenient so called [REDACTED] who quickly rearranged the time for me.Turned up and immediately the wheel was taken, the new tyre fitted and balanced and then bought back to the car and put in the boot. Great service all round and will definitely use them again and have already spread the word. I ebded up paying just lass than a third of the price of the originally fitted one."
Great job very pleased
Could not be faulted
could take 3 to 5 days to refund money
1st class service easy to use website
"Good choice, great price and very high quality service from the team at Spa Motors - my first time using [REDACTED] and I'm impressed!"
Very good prices & easy & quick to use
"Kind of feel strange leaving this review since I purchased from them based on the Truspilot's generally great feedback for this company...The appointment cancelled by a text. Alright, I thought.. this happens... The cancellation text followed by a polite email from one of their representatives... - 'We are working on it' etc.... Good, they are taking care of it... Unfortunately, no follow up the next day. An email sent to them.. and another one. Still no reply... - Right, looks like I will need to ring them, I thought. After 10 min of waiting finally managed to get through, but the line was so bad I was transferred to another call... 10 min... 15 min... no answer. I had to hang up and go back to work...I am selling my car and promised the guy I will put a new set of tyres on her... I know [REDACTED] doesn't care, but if they tell me they can get those fitted in two days and get good online reviews - well that's why I am buying from them and not elsewhere. I am kind of seriously stuck here because of them!***UPDATE***An email eventually came saying the tyres have been delivered and asking me if I had been aware of it and already had them fitted(???).... I replied saying noone let me know anything and I'm still awaiting for the appointment to be rescheduled. Guess what? No reply again. The next morning I decided I'm not going to deal with them via email any more, and just headed (without an appointment) to the garage in question and asked if they had received my tyres (they had). Explained what'd been going on and fortunately they kindly agreed to fit them for me. I'm not sure if this was just an isolated example of poor case handling by [REDACTED] or this is the way they treat their customers in general, should something go wrong.I normally don't have time for this sort of rubbish (unanswered emails, waiting in a phone queue for ages). You normally get a pretty decent customer service nowadays and its KEY to build good reputation for online retailers. Not good.*********************Hi TomI am really sorry for this issue.No, you are not. You don't care and only leave this comment here to make it look as if you care. This will be fully investigated to understand what has gone wrong and how we can improve it in future. No, it won't. Nobody will investigate anything. You will do NOTHING to improve this."
Professional service at excellent price
"Process straight forward, good price, friendly and efficient fitters but waiting room a joke. Cold and no seats. Surely providing seats is a bare minimum. Even bus shelters have seats."
All very easy from ordering the tyres to having them fitted would definitely use again
All worked to plan no problems
First time user of [REDACTED] and won't be the last. Great service and no problems at the fitters.
Very pleased with service comfortable waiting area. And price the cheapest as my husband looked around. Nobody else had my tyres in stock.
Very easy to use the website and excellent price and choice of garages to use for fitting.
Very impressed with the service provided and the competitive prices. Sadly the tyres couldn’t be delivered on the designated day but I was kept fully informed and offered next day delivery. Phoned customer service and the young lady couldn’t have been more helpful. Thoroughly recommend this company.
Price & choice of locations near you for fitting service.
Efficient and cost effective service. Thank you.
No hassle and great service.
"I had a great experience with [REDACTED], I originally ordered the wrong tyre, I called them and told them what happened and they switched it with the correct one with no extra cost. It was fitted as soon as possible."
Bought new Bridgestone all weather tyres having been stuck in Scottish highlands in snow and tested this weekend on ski vacation and they performed brilliantly! Don’t think I’ll waver from AWT again!
Very happy: a great price and excellent service from the local garage.
The service was quick and efficient from start to end. All ran smoothly. Brilliant.
"Second time I used them. Great variety of options (for all budgets). Clear communication on timings. Second time was a slight delay in delivery of my tyres, but was communicated in advance and alternate option was offered. Good service all in all."
"Excellent service.Easy to use.Competitive pricing.Good communication.First rate, will use again."
Excellent from ordering to fitting
I hadn't used [REDACTED] before but I'm glad I did this time.tyres excellent value for money delivered to garage of my choice very quickly.i particularly liked the choice of garages within my area .other competitors only use one or two companies restricting choice.will definitely use again
"It so simple and straight forward.Type in your car registration and select your tyres .Then it provides you with the local garage, select a time and place and turn up. I love it ! Any thing that simplifies my life is great ."
Good price and efficient service.
ATM euromaster in Falkirk were a nightmare to deal with so my fitting got swapped to Jim Dickson Cumbernauld who were excellent as always (five stars for them) Would have been five stars all round if I didn’t have to wait two and half weeks for my fitting to finally get sorted through euromaster advertising wrong weekend opening times then having no fitter on my fitting booked slot.
Did what it said on the tin
Easy to use. No problems
bought two Kuhumo tyres online(very good price and good tyres) polite and friendly technician who fitted the tyres in good time. I will use the service again
Top notch service as always!! Never “tyre” of using them!! Wahaaay!!
"The website was simple to use, and once the payment was made, all I had to do was turn up!"
Good choice of tyres at best price I could find.Didn’t save a massive amount but these were premium all weather tyres so didn’t expect to. Liked the idea of booking a convenient time at local fitter.Good all round service.
"As always, this is the best company for choosing tyres. There are wide choices of tyres to suit all budgets. Prices include fitted and non fitted. Reviews for each make of tyre help make the decision easier. I have no affiliation to this company but have used them for a few years now and have never had any problems."
"All good!. Good price, delivered and fitted on date stated. Will use again"
Really quick professional service. Made everything really easy as well as booking with garage. No charge for fitting and free tracking.
"Great choices, sensible prices."
"Easy to compare different tyres and choose the most suitable. Rapid and efficient service at the garage I choose for fitting. The only problem was that one tyre was over inflated at the time of fitting, causing a warning light when I went on the motorway. I know I ought to have rechecked the pressures myself...."
"Very easy process to select and order tyres, reviews of garages to fit tyres is helpful. Garage used was excellent very helpful.overall very good experience and value will use again."
"Competative pricing, good choice of dates, friendly approachable staff, accommodating and quick service fitted by Strathclyde Autotune"
Great service and fitting at recommended garage..A good price as well
Nothing to do with [REDACTED] but the garage that fitted them. Young lad with black oil covered overalls got in and drove my car into the bay and back out no plastic seat cover used would not recommend....... I dont pay 14k for s car and look after it for some mechanic with no respect to get in and not give a toss
"Really happy, able to choose tyres without any pressure, garage where they fitted we're freindly and efficient"
It's the best price. I was however surprised to be charged extra by the garage to move a tyre from the front to the rear in order to then fit the new tyres to the front
Easy to order and local fitter very good
The selected mobile fitter never turned up
Quick and easy to use and a lot cheaper
Not as competitively priced as you might think. Shop around.
"Great price and excellent, friendly service from Stortford Performance Tyres"
The experience was good but it does depend on the choice of tyres. For example i use Uniroyal on my NSX which are not listed on [REDACTED].
"Tyres were order on Monday with a appointment for Wednesday they failed to confirm the appointment held on to my money even tho the tyres were never sent out would avoid waste of time , spent awful lot of time waiting on phone to get connected to customer service , sent numerous emailed not a single reply total disaster , money still hasn’t been refunded even tho they were meant to do a bank transfer same day"
"Great price, great sevice. I will certainly use again. Recommended."
"Simple and cost effective home fitting. I made a mistake with the timings for the appointment to have the tyres fitted at home and [REDACTED] were very quick to help me out, rearranging my appointment as soon as they received my message."
"Fast service, the fitters were great. Friendly and helpful. Always use [REDACTED]"
"Top products , best prices , easy to arrange , very pleased from start to finish , 10/10"
"Reasonable priced tires (discounted via Direct Line Insurance). Had a few issues making payment on the website but resolved after speaking to my bank ... website was not recognised by TSB and they blocked purchase! Received confirmation email but didn’t contain a time slot. Chased this up with them and reply said AM before midday. Day before I got an email around 5pm to advise they can’t fulfil my order and they’ve cancelled my booking with garage. Attempted to move it to another date that I couldn’t attend due to work. Told them to cancel and requested a refund. Next day (original day of garage booking), I received a text / email advising tires have now arrived at garage and that I can call along to get them fitted. Arrived at garage who informed me tires had been there for three days! Very very poor customer service, messed me about and made me late for work. If it wasn’t for the discount provided via Direct Line I wouldn’t have used this company and doubt I will in future."
"It was nice and simple to do, once booked up taken to the local garage and done with in the hour."
"Easy to book, great service, all on time, and without any problems"
"Unbeatable price by far, really easy and no fuss, just how I like it, ordered the tyres and booked a time, turned up at the time and got them fitted, easy as that!"
Bought the tyres online 1 week before appointment to have them fitted. Turned up at my local ATS only to discover [REDACTED] had only delivered 1 of my 2 tyres. Was told they would try and bring it back out the same day but was not possible. They rearranged for the following Tuesday but then had to cancel again until the end of the week as they were unable to deliver. Not impressed I had to wait an extra week to have the tyres fitted plus I had to make a long journey on 1 very worn down tyre in poor wet winter weather. Hopefully I’ll have no issues with the actual tyres...
Amazing ! I would definetely recomend it !
Great way to order tyres. Fast and easy delivery to the garage. Will definitely recommend and use again.
Great price and communication throughout the process. Fitters were on time and very professional.
"Great experience, mobile fitters were excellent."
A first class experience 10/10
The online order was easy and the fitting at the Lakeside pit-stop took about an hour.My only frustration point was the guy at the fitting centre who took my phone no. and promised to call me once the job is done but didn't. Also at the end he was quite pushy begging for a 5-star review. In fact he mentioned that 4 or 5 times. It seems that the review was his main and only concern.
"Cheap, easy to book, no hassle."
"Couldnt have been easier. No push on a particular tyre, gave me the opportunity and time to find the tyres I wanted without stress. Then click and order, pick a slot nice and local, boom!"
"Great service, fantastic prices, good fitting times. Would definitely use again."
Tyre fitted as requested but thought they’d have set the tyre pressure. In the event I had to go straight to a garage to do this!
"Great price, fitted at home within 2 days, brilliant service"
Very good service the fitter was even 5 minutes early very satisfied definitely will use again
Great service used several times now very happy
Everything worked as it should will use again
Just the easiest solution - no fuss
"I had not used [REDACTED] before so was a bit apprehensive, but ordering the tyres and booking to have the tyres fitted at a local garage which I had previous used before, couldn't have been easier; and I saved a whooping £100 on the price the same garage has quoted!!Will definitely be using [REDACTED] again :)"
"Went to recommended garage . Two days later whilst travelling on M25 with my famliy decided to turn on my ice cold airconditioning . Thats funny not working. Got to my destination found fuse had been remove? Put in spare fuse aircon worked straight away. The garage are in denial about what they done. CAUGHT YOU OUT . Giving [REDACTED] a bad name. Not [REDACTED] fault but make sure you watch the fitters when replacing your tyres its you car not theirs ,and they wont be able to try and con you. Especially airCON."
Always a great experience. Good range and choice of tyres and local fitters. Very happy
"Great service smooth transaction. Very smooth transaction, all aspects of the purchase executed as stated, cannot fault. Tyres are perfectly as expected and were fitted as arranged with a great fitting service. Will definitely use this company again when tyres are next needed."
Excellent value and [REDACTED] kept me informed about the progression of my order.
"Great service yet again, would definitely recommend."
hassle free service. I would use [REDACTED] again
"Excellent service, easy to use no fuss, straight forward and convenient. The fact that it was possible to choose my new tyres on line, compare prices and arrange fitting by a local garage, what could be easier?Keep up the good work.Steve G."
"Website easy to use, prices good and good choice of fitting companies. Would use again."
A very good service from start to finish
"Good price.All arrangements were spot onVery good service at garage Good experience, will use this again"
Can't fault [REDACTED] really. I did a call around for prices and took advantage of the [REDACTED] flash sale. It saved money even without the sale discount. I even told the garages I was calling around checking prices. The fitting garage was excellent but I felt a little guilty they did all the work for just the fitting price but they made a bit more as I knew my tracking was out. Nice touch is I was offered interest free credit via PayPal so it took some of the pain away too. Over all excellent. Use as a benchmark but their deals are good.
Good service no problems and helpful.
Picked the wrong tyres but got an email to tell me so and order changed at no extra cost.
"Great price, great customer experience at the garage I chose. Couldn‚Äôt fault the whole thing"
Quick and easy way to buy tyres.
On- line order with [REDACTED] very quick and simple - with excellent choice of tyres and local fitters. I saved nearly £50 on two tyres. Would heartily recommend [REDACTED].
Easy to find tyres & book an appointment
Great experience as previously bought from [REDACTED].I recommend the fitted option . Quality tyres priced lower than the tyre centres nearby my home .Thank you once again !
Never used them before but will next time
Garage that fitted tyres were so quickly
Easy to use. Great value.
Excellent fitting service- but I guess that this may vary.Not suitable if need tyres immediately.
Hassle free way to arrange for new tyres. Read up on the rating to make an informed choice of manufacturer. Easy checkout out and procedure to arrange fitting
"I've used [REDACTED] a few times over the last couple of years, having the tyres delivered to a local fitter and booking in an appointment. The prices have been very competitive and the service excellent."
"Really poor communication. Ordered tyres on a Wednesday, to be fitted on Friday. Ended up being emailed 15 minutes before closing on the Thursday to inform that my pre-paid order for 4 tyres would be delayed until Tuesday. Customer service were very unhelpful and didn’t offer an acceptable solution. Had much better experiences with other online tyre retailers like ASDA tyres."
"I have used BC before and been happy, but on this occasion I had to wait two weeks and had 3 cancelled appointments. I even had reminders about the appointments, but when I turned up they hadn't even delivered the tyre to the garage. I won't be using them again."
Efficient service. Reasonable pricesTyres delivered as specified.
Tyre arrived no issues however selected garage who fitted the tyre left glue on the interior of my car and wont come off so not happy with them! Would use [REDACTED] again but give the garage ATS euromaster a wide birth!
"Amazing price, quick delivery and fantastic choice of tyre fitters! Would definitely recommend."
"Great service, excellent customer care, no complaints Thank you very much"
Great fast delivery of quality tyres at good prices. Great fast delivery of tyres to my selected garage for fitting. Plenty of tyre choice and garages. Also offered discount on michelin tyres
It was convenient. The person who attended was professional and polite.
Very pleased with all aspects of the service provided
Best price great service
Competitive prices and easy to book. Good advice from the fitting company.
Excellent experience. Very simple process from start to finish. Defo would recommend it.
"Best value tyre service on the UK market, if you have tried the rest, you will like the best, if you go to [REDACTED]."
"A very good service up to the point where I had to change my tyre choice before fitting. Then, [REDACTED] telephone system and response was pathetic and expensive. But the company have now recognised this and said they will revise their telephone help line number arrangements. On that basis I recommend them and will use them in future. They appear to be the best value."
love the price
Hassle free. On time.
"Have been using BC for a few years now, it’s so simple to order and select your own fitting centre. A truly excellent business model!"
"Trustworthy Easy to use website! Very straight forward, good selection of tyre to choose from and garages near by for you to pick from. Arrives on the date you pick hassle free and good quality. Ordered a few times now, makes life simple doing it this way dont have to wait for garage opening times which is hard if you work silly shifts like myself."
Really pleased the whole experience went smoothly and was good value for money I would definitely use them again
"Great price, great service. Thoroughly recommended."
"Always use [REDACTED] for my tyres. Excellent prices and service , fitted locally by my local garage. With a great choice of tyre makes for all budgets. My local tyre centres can‚Äôt beat their prices."
Use every time.
Best price I could find. Used Mobile fitting service Wiltshire Tyres. Excellent job fitting.
"Great price, hassle free, no problems, Thankyou"
"Fair honest prices and easy to check compatability. Only negative: no guaranteed time slot, just a.m. or p.m. but fortunately fitter found immediate slot"
"Tyre centre advertising time slots they cannot fulfill had to rebook at a later date. Then when appointment rebooked Very slow service, arrived at appointed time but car left waiting for 35minutes before they even started the job which then took 2 hours to fit 4 tyres. Can’t complain about the workmanship but being expected to wait that long in a grotty waiting area is unacceptable"
Good selection of tyres at reasonable prices. Ordering procedure is straight forward .
Four new tyres for my Audi A4 Allroad all delivered to my local tyre company and fitted on time. No airguns on the wheel nuts and all torqued up by hand. Perfect balancing - very pleased all round!
Very easy website to use. Ordered on the Website Wednesday night. They were delivered to my local garage & were fitted on the Saturday. Would definatly recommend. They were also the cheapest company I could find.
"Got exactly what I paid for, fitted when I needed it to be done with no hassle, whilst I ate doughnuts. I will use them again and I will recommend them to friends and family."
Fantastic service will definitely use again
"Fast, easy and efficient service at a good price."
"Great prices, brilliant service will recommend and use again."
Took two full weeks from payment to getting my tires fitted. Shouldn’t be recommending and selling tires that they clearly didn’t actually have available. Have used [REDACTED] a few times previously and have found the service has deteriorated the last twice I’ve Used them. Would definitely look elsewhere before using them again.
"The ease of been able to see the difference in grade of tyres to suit,then buy and arrange a time that suits you for them to be fitted"
Cheapest tyre so could find. Local garage fitted them and no extra cost. Fast and efficient service.
"Best price online, also fast and convenient service will definitely use again."
"Great online ordering service, tyre booked in with my chosen garage, delivered without delay and fitted on time by a professional garage."
"Fantastic local fitting service, great pricing and easy transaction with good comms too."
Third time using [REDACTED]. It so easy and cuts out all the dealer bull***t and time that happens when getting quotes.
"Easy to order and the garage I used was close by and very quick, changing 2 tyres as I waited, 20 mins later I was away, and in for work before 9am!"
Great price and professional service. Thank you.
Really bad service.. Asked for an 8am slot got an 11 called up and had an 8:30 confirmed for another garage and they again couldn't do it before 12. Highly disappointed.
Good selection of tyres fitted at reasonable prices where you choose
Happy with my tyres and the price. Always a good easy service with [REDACTED].
"First class service and prices, would not go anywhere else again."
Easy way to buy and arrange to fit tyres.
First time using [REDACTED]. A bit dubious at first what was I going to get??? Well I am very pleased with the service and the price. I used the Thurrock branch. The two guys there friendly helpful and efficient. I have recommended [REDACTED] to family and friends. Friends have used them since and the feed back I got from them was a very positive one about [REDACTED]. Well done guys
Ordered my caravan tyre online and selected my fitter. All went well no probs great communication at all times during the purchase and fitting. Will definitely use again.
Tyres and delivery all good. Used premier [REDACTED] fitting shop and alloys were damaged in tyre change. Management claimed they were damaged prior to the tyre change which is not true. I had only just had the alloys refurbed Wish I had taken a photo before I left car with them. There was no joint pre inspection. Sad you can’t trust
good products at a good price.
Last minute delay in delivery of tyres was sorted after phone call. Local fitters very helpful.
Great service - tyres arrived at appointed garage and at the right time. Not a huge saving price wise but every little bit helps.
"The selection of my tyres was made easy, the fitting was excellent too. Thank you and keep it up."
Tried out a quality budget tyre (winter) and when fitted I found them to be very good hope they last without any problems --- Can't go wrong to get two tyre's for the price of ONE well-known brand
"Very competitive prices. Tyres fitted in Local Just Tyres by a knowledgeable, friendly engineer. Have used before and will use again."
"Good prices, tyres were good quality and did turn up...eventually. Communication + delivery from [REDACTED] towards fitting garage was lacking. I order 2 tyres including fitting. Fitting date pushed back twice (by [REDACTED]). Went to appointment and was told on phone some time later that only 1 tyre had turned up. Following multiple phone calls, emails and multiple additional appointment changes I finally got my 2nd tyre fitted almost 3 weeks after I ordered it. People on phone were nice and helpful but logistics / service delivery not so great."
"I have used [REDACTED] several times, in three different Fitting Garages with excellent results. Easy to order, easy to pay and great communications from the company. Unfortunately, my latest experience was married slightly by the Tyre Fitting Garage having an attitude that made me feel like I was in the way. The fitter spent 10 minutes on his mobile phone in the middle of the job and when I asked the Receptionist if they would swap the tyres ""front to back and back to front"" I was told there would be a charge of £6.99 per wheel, despite the car already being raised to fit two new tyres. I'll definitely be using [REDACTED] again but not at that particular fitting shop."
Quick reliable inexpensive service.
Efficient online ordering service but fitting partner used in this instance was not helpful. It felt like other customers were getting preferential treatment because I had purchased through [REDACTED] rather than direct with the fitting partner.
Already done a review
"Did not update time on website so booked in to an unavailable slot. When told slot not available help desk was not helpful and only asked when I was available which considering they could not tell me when the garage was available led to a chicken and egg situation. Although tyres were fitted well at the garage, [REDACTED] but not be very good middle men"
Used [REDACTED] a fair few times with no issues. The most recent time they cancelled the tyre fitting via email stating garage couldn’t support the fitment. I went to the garage who could support it. So had a lengthy process to get it re booked with calls not getting answered. Would be better for [REDACTED] to call the garage to confirm rather than just cancelling via an email which may go unnoticed. 2 minute job.
I had two michelin pilot sport 4's fitted. [REDACTED] were the cheapest I found and Uckfield motors fitted without any issues.
"Slight hick-up getting all four tyres for delivery. Fitting date missed twice. However [REDACTED] kept me updated of the problem causing the delay. Mobile fitter used was excellent (appeared when advised, polite and efficient)."
"Very good service, rearranged garage when first choice was not available.Great service by the garage as well."
Easy to order. Delivery and fitting completed as scheduled
Fast and reliable service .Tyres now on my Defender.Well pleased!
Best price and choice of fitting centre
I was very impressed with the fitting company. The Tyers were at the garage as agreed. Good communication.
very good [REDACTED]
"I had used [REDACTED] a good number of years ago. Their prices are very good. And I had excellent service from the fitting centre, M Y Motoring Centres - Premier PartnerUnits D & E Chalmers Way, Invicta Business Centre, Gillingham , Kent, ME8 6PF.Both highly recommended."
Booked online and was very pleased with the service I received. Any information I needed was given an honest response. Would recommend.
Great price choice of local garage to fit the tyres ... what’s not to like?
"Very competitive prices, easy to navigate and order on website, timeslots for fitting, quick fitting times and so far have never been running behind with fittings. Friendly staff. Have used many times!"
Great value 👍 good service and delivery to mygarage of choice plus 0% finance option
V responsive customer service...friendly and professional installation. Chosen tyres (x4) not in stock so got an upgrade for free!! Would use again.
Ordering was easy and the service at the tyre centre was very good.
Good value service. I particularly liked the option of mobile service allowing my tyres to be changed while I got on with my work. Unfortunately the technician was unable to refit my AlloyGators or to fit fresh ones.
"Very impressed with service.Found website very easy to use, choice and description of tyres was excellent. Prices extremely competitive too. Booking a specific fitting time with a local business was very useful and within 30 minutes I was on my way again - highly recommended..!"
"Great price and all went seamlessly, would use again"
Excellent price on branded tyres saving around £30 on the fitted price
Great site with amazing deals and prices and easy to use
"This is the fourth time I've used [REDACTED], always been impressed with how easy is to get right tyres for my car and decent range of options for fitting. I live in a city and there are always three or four options almost on my doorstep."
Always use [REDACTED]. Unbeatable prices and very convenient. Why go elsewhere?
Tyeres came on time flitted on time couldn't ask for a better service
"Everything went to plan, fitting went without a clinch. The only minus point was that the tyres cost more than another supplier but the‘[REDACTED]’ fitting partner was closer for travel."
"I ordered four tyres, knowing I needed two fronts and there was a nail in one of the rear tyres. The ordering was straight forward, simple and easy to use and all done within 10 mins. When I needed to change the installation date, a quick call to customer services and all was sorted in 15 minutes with confirmation of my new desired installation date sent through.On the day, the fitter pointed out that I had more than 50% tread on the rear tyres. After inspecting the nail in the rear tyre and realising it was ~2mm long and had not affected the tyre it was decided only the front tyres would be changed.Ringing up to arrange for the two surplus tyres was quick and painless, with the money being issued back to me within 48 hours.Exceptional customer service from start to finish and why I’ll keep coming back as a customer."
"Basically it worked. I bought 4 tyres, and saved over £60 including fitting locally"
Very easy to buy tyres. Arranged with local fitter through [REDACTED]. Highly recommend
Really happy with my purchase of 4 new tyres. £80 cheaper than going to the garage direct!
Great prices. Lakeside fitting was easy and fast. Great guy called Barney. Happy customer 😀
"Brilliant, I dropped my car off the night before , thinking it would save me time in the morning but when I got there, they said they could sort it there and then. A very friendly garage and super efficient too ."
"Easy to do, very satisfied and saved money ."
Fast turn round with ver helpful and friendly staff
Great price with a professional service by [REDACTED] and MB tyre and autocentre.
First time using [REDACTED] and it won’t be he last . So easy to find the right tyres and a place to fit them . Picked a day that suits and paid . Turned up to the garage to get them fitted and they were waiting for me . I’ll definitely use [REDACTED] next time I buy tyres
Staff very helpful and professional. Proper!!
"Excellent serviced very easy to order, also fitted at local garage a fab family business.Will order from you again. Thank you. Bev Adams (Mr)"
Hassle free discounted tyres! Would recommend!
Really good experience. A great choice of tyres online with good prices and you can choose a date and garage that suits you. Will definitely use again.
Great choice and ease of use
Good selection of tyres. Easy to use website. Very good fitting service.
Very happy with the service - had a few problems as garage we booked into had double booked but your team sorted this out and sent us a mobile fitter - which we will definitely use again
Never used before but I found it easy to use a local garage to fit my tyres rather than drive 15 miles to get what I wanted which was good quality budget tyres. I ended up buying own brand and they seem to be excellent so far. Definitely worth a try in my view!
"After shopping round for all terrain tyres I found the site [REDACTED].com, it was so easy to select a tyre and have them fitted at a local garage. On this occasion I need specialist tyres but would definitely use for normal tyres. So much easier than going to various garages or phoning round. I will be using [REDACTED].com again."
Very good! Order normal tires by mistake instead of run flats it was then that noticed and contacted me to make me aware and changed them without any fuss!
They everything when they said they would and the tyre fitting company was spot on so all in all a very good job all round.
"Efficient, hassle free and good value for money. Will be using again"
"Great service, best price, perfect 👍"
"Excellent service. Fast, easy to use system to identify correct tyres, place order, pay and arrange fitting. Highly recommended!"
"Good service, quick delivery and good prices. Be aware to ring the fitting company to make sure an appointment has actually been made."
"Tyres in time. Needed 4, looked at all tyres and judged the tyres chosen as the best middle range. Look good and seem to do the job, only time will tell if they are value for money. The surprised look on the tyre fitters face when he saw the brand was a worry but hopefully just because we didn't by direct from ATS."
"I bought rotallia and they send me different brand and they inform me after 5 days, 1 day before my appointment. I booked same extra service but we they fit the tyres they didn't check them. poor service from [REDACTED] and from garage as well."
"Easy to deal with, customer service excellent"
Special offer on the tyre I needed. Easy online exp. quick appt next day at my local fitter and will use again.
Good value and good choice. Easy to use website. Was able to order tyres and fitting in one go.
"No problem, quick and easy"
"Great all round service, friendly & helpful staff, competitive prices - will use again"
Recemendations by my son -in-law who is a petrol head.Good tyres but when fitted only one had the coloured bandso you see on new tyres leading me to think it was not entirely brandnew althoughost it had all little rubber spikes on the tyre wall
"After a case of misinformation with an order a week earlier, I was given a 10% discount off my next order. As my wife needed two new tyres I decided to give BC another go. This time it was faultless with correct communication regarding fitting time and the selected fitter completed the job within 15 mins of me arriving. Confidence restored!"
"Great price, easy to order 24hours a day choose gararge"
"Good tyres at good price. My initial fitting date I requested at time of booking had to be changed as garage were not available at this time despite site saying otherwise. Other than that, good service."
"From my mind it's very difficult for anyone to beat the prices offered by [REDACTED], especially for premium brand tyres. My number 1 go to place for tyres everytime."
Ok service at start but mess about on fitting the tyres
"Helpful advice over my initial Michelin tyre choice which was not approved by BMW as not specifically ""star"" accepted. Good local garage fitted."
"Great service, the option to get tyre changed at home or work etc was amazing..quick and easy fitting, would not go anywhere else now...thanks ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
Competitive prices and clear to use website
"Good prices, good choice of local fitters, quick turnaround of order"
Alway have good experience.
Good price Delivered and fitted on time
Excellent service. Definitely would use them again and recommend
Easy booking online and fitter was quick when he arrived. Would have liked a shorter time slot rather than waiting most of the morning. Or a live update on fitter arrival.
"Great prices and buying experience but queries take a while to be resolved. On the whole my experience with them is great. The only reason I’ve given them 4 stars is due to how difficult it is to reach their customer services, by email only in my experience which goes to a central mailbox, once it’s there you are dealt with - not necessarily with the same person throughout the query and it took a couple of days to settle my query with emails going back and forth - but it does get sorted. But in my experience you just can’t get through over the phone which for me was just a little frustrating and meant my query settlement took days instead of being sorted in one phone call. But the prices are great and my local fitting centre was absolutely brilliant."
Very easy to use and surprisingly cheap especially having 19” low profiles I was extremely happy with the price and speed in which the tyre was ordered and fitted 👌🏻
"No fault, all in order"
As ever top service from ATS. can't fault them. Also helps an ex student from my school works there!!
"Excellent quick service, very easy to use and ensures you get exactly the tyres you want."
"Efficient, courteous service. Tyres well fitted"
"Absolutely no problem, 4 tyres delivered and fitted as promised."
I always use these guys now. Have done for past 6 years.
polite and helpful thankyou
This is the second time I have bought tyres through [REDACTED] and find it a very simple process with very reasonable prices and book a fitting time of your choice and where.Would highly recommend to anyone.
"Quick and easy serviceThe guys there are happy, jolly and approachable. They were honest with me and put me at ease as i don't really know much about cars. I have used them previously for my MOT and i will go back there for when i get my other 2 tyre's done in the future."
I am very happy & satisfied with both Blakcircles where I bought my tyre on line & S&T auto which fitted my tyre. Will recommend [REDACTED] to all my friends & families. Good value for money
Excellent service and very competative prices. Tyres were fitted at the time and date agreed. Very pleased with the overall service.
"Merittyre fitters in farnham were rude an unhelpful, it seemed as I was a [REDACTED] customer they were not interested."
I found the site easy to use in finding the tyres I wanted at a competitive price and to book an appointment at a location & time that suited me
"Delighted with the entire process.Fast, efficient and favourable prices.I shall need 2 more tyres in the next month or so and will certainly buy from [REDACTED] again."
Does exactly what it says on the tin :)
Convenient with handy tyre reviews. Watch out for offers (& note Kwikfit - other retailers are available- will price-match).
"Thanks for a great service the tyres were a very good price and Mr tyres in Stafford done a fantastic job ,the lads there are very friendly and approachable and made me feel at ease. Thanks to all for a great experience."
"A simple process to order your tyres, book a local fitter and get the best price. Works very well."
Good service competitive prices had to wait a little longer than expected
Easy to order online. Fitted at home by a mobile tyre fitter. I would use them again and will recommend to others.
Everything exactly as planned and much less expensive than kwik fit etc. Happy customer. Garage I went to were also very informative and the lady at the desk provided excellent customer service.
Great company. Great service. Great Value.
Excellent service Excellent prices Easy to buy Convenient for the address
Have tried them for a while on different weather conditions and they're good for water as they have a good grip on the road. They are not that loud but the fuel consumption has increased since having these tires. Overall good quality price and product.
"The tyres arrived in good time at the fitting agent (ATS). Good price, good product and good service. I have used before and will use again."
Easy to match my requirements with available tyres from a wide range at a price that suits my budget. Good service at a nearby centre. Very pleased.
The guys at Staplehurst Tyres are fantastic. [REDACTED] saved me £20 a tyre for my wife's small car. Appointment makes things very convenient.
Quick easy to use and find the cheapest
Excellent service and brilliant tyres.
"Easy, very speedy deliver (the next day). Good value in general. Painless stuff."
"Great value for money, easy to buy and arrange fitting"
"ordered tyres a week before I needed them and booked the fitting.they phoned up and emailed the day before to say my tyres were not going to be delivered on time so they had booked me in for a new fitting a couple of days away.turns out my tyres did arrive, they informed me the morning of the original appointment.so it was all sorted in the end relatively hassle free.good price for the tyres too and the exact same make that were already on the car. saved about £100."
"Easy to use website , fantastic price and quick fitting at my local garage."
All round very good service!
"I recently purchased Taurus tyres with [REDACTED] lifetime warranty. I had an irreparable puncture in one of the tyres couple of days later. I called [REDACTED] and they arranged for a replacement tyre, no quibble and no bother. I was truly impressed with this service as I really had not expected to actually ever benefit from the warranty....Well done bc.com - you've done great....!! 😊🤗"
"2 orders placed for 2 separate cars. 1 set of tyres did not arrive had to wait an additional week.Called 6pm night before other set of tyres due to be fitted to be told they also were delayed. Not the first time this has happened, wont be using again"
"This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] prices are very good, but I don’t recommend to go to ats Altrincham, as requested I arrived early asked how long it would be, I had a sharp answer it won’t go in till 9am ( the time I was booked in) and it will be ready at 10.30am,although there was only one car in, this is the second time this has happened to me and I am convinced that they don’t like doing [REDACTED] work.ATS is owned by mitchelin and can’t compete with [REDACTED], I saved £10.00 per tyre"
"Excellent choices of tyres but one badly fitted.Valve not fitted correctly,tyre went flat and had to take it back to F1 tyres Doncaster.NOT VERY HAPPY!ALL THE GUY WANTED TO KNOW WAS DO I WANT ANY MORE FOR THE REAR.WILL NOT BE USING THEM AGAIN OR RECOMMENDING THEM"
"Great value tyres great quality fast delivery to any tyre fitter at a time and day to suit you , will use again"
Excellent service. Supply to fit was professional with no hidden extras. Great price.
Good price. Excellent service.
BF Goodrich All Terrain T/A KO2 (Raised White Lettering) 275/70 R16Have used [REDACTED].com before and always found there service excellent. Even when I had a query about these tyres I got a helpful reply fairly quickly. Would recommend the service to all
It was good deal
Needed 4 new tyres and shopped around a wee bit. Used BC before and decided to go with them again. Arrived early at my chosen garage and my car was checked over and I signed the waver. Car was done quick and I was delighted with the way the car drives & feels. Will use BC again next time.
"I had 4 new Yokohama Tyres which I had installed on 21st December. I brought the vehicle back to the fitting centre a couple of days later. As two of the tyres keep deflating, the fitting centre checked the tyres and could not find a puncture on either of the tyres. So there was no charge for this service, they did tighten the valves. I have had this problem ongoing ever since, and have had no response from [REDACTED].com I have emailed and tweeted them!!!Clearly two of these tyres must be faulty, and should be replaced by Balckcircles. I am hoping it is just a case that customer services have not had a chance to respond to any of my messages. Only time will tell!"
"It was very easy to find the tyres that I wanted on the [REDACTED] website and to place the order at a convenient garage. On the day, the tyres had been delivered and were ready for fitting. The garage said that the car would be ready for collection in an hour and it was. I wouldn't hesitate to use this service again."
"Booked an appointment to get tyres fitted at Silverburn. Good price and sorted out while I went for a coffee. No nonsense, love [REDACTED]."
Great service and great price for tyres.
"Quick, easy and very reasonably priced."
GOOD service !
"Great service, happy..the women on reception with Rani Mukherjee voice is amazing ;-)"
"We’ll organised, quick and easy and cheap. I have used [REDACTED] for many years and never had an issue. I’ve experienced this from around ten different garages over that time."
Had to purchase four new tyres for my Nissan Duke. Tyres were reasonably priced and what swayed me were tyres had reviews so it was easier to make a decision based on price and quality. Was easy to book appointment slot at my local garage at my convenience Would recommend
"Good result, value for money"
Not clearly marked when purchasing continental run flats beware when buying on [REDACTED]
"Tyres at a good price, with fast delivery. Recommended garage fitted the tyres promptly."
"Great choice of Tyres , price was around 20% lower than those I found on major drive in retailers websites for the brand and type I wanted . Able to book installation at a time that was convenient to me, close to home. Overall great price and service."
Simple and smooth service
Great! Convenient! Easy!
A brilliant service And very good price
No problems all went smoothly
"Excellent choice, competitive prices. Wide range plus mobile fitting an option. No additional sales push like you often get at a tyre centres."
Really easy to browse and choose my tyres which were made available a day later at my chosen tyre dealer. All round efficient and prompt service at a very competitive price.
Quick and trouble free fitting plus free valet.
Good price although the guys doing the service were not all paying attention to the details. I saw some wheel covers facing down the raw floor being pushed with the foot while the client was there and looking... glad I didn't have any! I've also left with some standard tyre lids/caps and I had to return to recover the original ones apparently from the bin.
"Can’t give a better review I am afraid. I booked to have my new tyres fitted on Thursday for the following Tuesday at my local ATS. I was given a choice of fitting times and dates and regular updates on my appointment. Only when I arrived at the garage have taken time off work was I told the tyres hadn’t arrived. Come on - that is not acceptable ! To be fair ATS were great, and booked me in promptly when then tyres finally did arrive but it was a cock up before that."
Great price and good availability ; faster than dealerships to arrange supply and partnership with ATS works well .
"Awesome experience - they had exactly what I needed and dispatched it super quick! Oh, and all for a very good price!"
"Tyre fitter at Lakeside was excellent, and happy with the tyres and the price. I had to wait for the tyres to be delivered which was ok. However, that’s when it became disappointing. I receive notification at 8:50 am one morning that I should go to have my tires fitted at 9:45 that same morning. That was simply not enough notice!The fitters were reluctant to fit the tires without authorisation from head office… So would I contact head office. I tried to phone, to receive a message saying that they were so busy, unless it was an emergency, please phone back later. I then decided to send an email, to which I’ve still had no response. So I phoned again, only to receive exactly the same message, but they were so busy, but couldn’t talk to me, and could iPhone back.So I had paid for my tires, they had been delivered, but I was struggling to get them fitted. Eventually they were fitted of course. So whilst the tire fitting centre Staff were very good, contact with head office was appalling."
nice people excellent job
"I chose to buy my tires from [REDACTED].com and have them delivered to McConechy's Tyre & Auto Centre in Montrose. I turned up Saturday morning to the centre, tires were there and were fitted straight away. A first class service and would defiantly use them both again. Thank you."
Was taken at time booked and job finished within 30 minutes. Easy easy and good value. Pleasant staff
"Excellent price.All proceeded without any problems, notwithstanding the weather (early snow). Recommended without reservation."
The entire process was seamless from start to finish providing both an excellent quality product and service.
Quick & easy to use highly recommended
"Buying is great fitting not so. The purchasing of the tyres was excellent, the fitting experience was not. I know [REDACTED] have no control over the fitters but I chose ATS & wished I hadn’t. 2 hours to fit 4 tyres! Then they didn’t know how to reset the tyre pressure sensor for my car so I had to get the manual out and go through it all. A really stressful experience I shan’t wish to repeat."
first class service
Cheapest choice. No added extras. Came when said and fitted with no issues.
Excellent...couldn't fault the service will definitely be my preferred choice in the future !! .
Excellent service from start to finish ! Recommend!!!
"Easy ordering, convenient garage for fitting. Would have been 5* if hadn’t run an hour late for the fitting. Will definitely use again though"
"Used [REDACTED] twice now ,just hassle free,will use again"
Just the easiest way to buy tyres in the comfort of your own home. Plenty of choice and easy to arrange fitting at your convenience.
Delivered on all fronts as it had stated. Recommended
"Polite greeting on arrival, quick service, good price, very impressed."
Very accommodating when I had to change appointment at very short notice
"Service very good, no problems."
Good efficient service. ATS Hastings always more than helpful
Tyres delivered on time to garage but time slot originally made to coincide with mot at same garage was moved 2 hours earlier so had to wait around for an extra 2 hours so everything was done
Tyre buying could not made any easer.Select by car or tyre size and select from different brands or prices and choose fitted it self fit and awaybyou go . Bargain prices and local fitting easy !
"This was my first visit to [REDACTED] in Bletchely, and it certainly won't be my last! The guys were excellent, very professional and so fast! They really were just all round nice guys and I'll definitely be going back for all my future tires!Thanks again!"
Everything was fine
Everything was easy - from choosing tyres to the fitting. No problems at all. Will use again.
Very happy with the service even when I changed my mind on the tyres I had ordered. Customer service was excellent and I would not hesitate to use or recommend to others.
Great value and very convenient!
"Not used [REDACTED] before, but thought I'd give them a try; couldn't be easier to do. Ordered tyres, booked appointment at the same garage I would have used anyway, saved £12 a tyre. Simples! Highly recommended."
"Honest,quick,cheap,near,profesional fitingWell done !"
"10/10 for easy to use and navigate website offering great products and efficient booking system with professional garage choices. I chose Hawick Autocare Ltd and again they were polite, efficient and extremely helpful."
"good value, swift no nonsense service"
"Great price that beats all. So glad I found [REDACTED], and could not believe the price difference compared to others. I’ve saved well over £500 for a set of Avon white wall tires for a Rolls-Royce and the purchase price included fitting and disposal. Just one thing to note double check with the selected garage to make sure they can do the chosen time&date as relaid a message back to [REDACTED] to say it’s not possible but didn’t I don’t self, but the garage was great help in fitting them a day earlier"
Exactly what say say they will do they do!!!Excellent reliable service
Always cheaper.
Fast helpful service. George Poole garage in New Mills were excellent! Highly recommended.
"Great tires, good delivery service."
A simple and straightforward experience from pricing and ordering my tyres through to having them fitted. I would definitely recommend [REDACTED] - this is my second time using them and will continue to do so. They are good to deal with and the price is always very competitive.
"Amazing price on michelins and I had the home sevice which was very professional, polite and helpful. No more sitting in tyre garages for me."
Great service. I would recommend [REDACTED] to friends and family
"I was sceptical about using this service beforehand, but it was easy to make an informed decision which tyres to buy, despite being no expert. I was worried the garage mightn’t have been overly pleased as they make nothing on the tyre, so was expecting a hard up sell from them, but they were as kind and courteous as you’d expect! I have recommended [REDACTED] and will be using them every time from now on."
"On line purchase and booking is easy, particularly when your car details are already saved.I have used this service 4 times now. The local garage fit at the appointed time and offer a very friendly service with no pressuring to purchase other services. This, plus the opportunity to save a few pounds, means using [REDACTED] is a no-brainer for me."
"My second purchase from them, and although there was a delay on supply, they were prompt to sort. They offer competitive prices."
Great service.great fitters will definitely use again
Great service even when I couldn’t get the fitting date booked.[REDACTED] arranged for the tyre fitter to come to me at know extra charge.
Superb price and service?
"Second time buying from [REDACTED], right product at a good price Fitted and balanced."
freindly obliging garage
"Excellent service, good prices highly recommend to anyone"
Very easy to order and reminders to double-check tyre size must have saved many awkward moments! Good price and excellent integration with fitters.
A simple easy process and did what they said they'd do! Definitely worth paying for fitting at an agreed depot.
Used them before will do so again because they are the best great service great prices
"Excellent, hassle free service. I would definitely use again"
"First class, got a very competitive rate on my tyres & found the garage jacks in Glenrothes to be extremely friendly and efficient."
"I like to use [REDACTED] for my new tyres, because they are nearly always cheaper than other online companies. I first check with [REDACTED] , then check with others sites & return to [REDACTED] for their tyres. [REDACTED] also have an excellent customer service & should you have any concerns they will reply. ALL I CAN SAY IS THANKYOU [REDACTED]."
quick and easy and were able to find wide range of products at reasonable prices
Easy to use Pleased with garage
"Tyres delivered on time, friendly fitting service"
Great. Helpful. Would use again.
Easy to use and plenty of choice
Very easy to use and great service
Hi I had my tyres fitted OK but the garage gave me a lift back to my house but waited three and a half hours to get back with a friend in the end very poor service on that part. The job should be a bit over an hour to do what is an appointment for it wasted my day
"Fast, efficient service.Booked online and arrived for appointment, tyres fitted within half an hour.."
Fast and simple service. Good price and got the job done when needed.
Great price tyres with a great service. Online purchase and fitting service is very simple and works well.Highly recommended.
Was good and easy.
From 1st contact to completion every thing was controlled and smooth.Web site offers multiple choice with clear information to aid your choice.Staff were polite and efficient and progress was monitered and communicated at all stages.In all a first class service and I highly recommend [REDACTED]
"The service from [REDACTED] is great. Pick the tyres you want, say where you want them fitted and pay. You go to the fitters and they are there waiting for you. I won't use those fitters again but I will use [REDACTED]."
Great value. Great Service
"Easy, good value and the guy who came was really nice, getting the job done quickly and efficiently.Never used this kind of service before, but won't be going back!"
"No complaints, tyres had been delivered to the garage of my choice and were fitted quickly and without any problems. a very good service which i'll certainly use again."
"Excellent service, easy to use. Great prices"
[REDACTED] was great tyres are good quality for a good price a good choice of tyres to suit all ranges and recommended a good garage to fit would defo go with them again will be replacing back tyres in June so will be back and recommend to friends and family
Very easy to use. I use [REDACTED] every time I need tyres!
"easy to choose tyres, local fitment available very quickly"
Used thus service before and was very impressed with the service and price
"This is the first time i have used this company. I ordered my tyres which were delivered quickly, however when they came they were not run flats which I needed (i should have ticked the run flat option). I phoned [REDACTED] and explained and within a day or two the correct tyres were delivered to the garage and the others were picked up. I cannot fault the service I received and will definitely use this company again."
Service was very good. No complaints whatever and very good price on the tyres purchased.
Very helpful and knowledgeable garage. I’ve used [REDACTED] 6 or 7 times; won’t be using anyone else.
The process was really simple. The staff when I spoke to them were exceptionally helpful and supportive. I made a mistake with my order and they handled the changes required with professionalism and friendliness. Really pleased with service and price. Will definetly use them again
It works. Though price not very competitive
Tyres fitted on the date and time arrangedNo problems and good value
"Great tyres, great and easy to use service. Would recommend!"
Good price on the tyre. Garage I used to fit were also spot on. Will be using the garage for all future car issues.
"Very good price for the tyres and excellent service with the fitting, could'nt have asked for more. Will definately use again. Thank you."
Easy and trouble free transaction. I bought 2 front tyres at a very reasonable price and had them fitted at my local tyrespot. The fitter was very pleasant and helpful.
"I have been using [REDACTED] for a number of years now, supplying me with new tires. Great service, easy to use website and good price."
Really pleased with the service. The only improvement I could suggest is if the fitter could let customers know when they are running late. Will definitely use again.
Totally great service by lovely well manered guys!
Make appt then told tyres weren't delivered then told they were so managed to keep same slot. Good value tyres and excellent service by Tudor Car Services Barrow in Furness
Excellent Service Great Value would recommend to friends 100%
"great service wether you are ordering a full set of tyres or just 1 like I did , you get the same good personal tailored service and at a good price"
Well organised and easy to use. Tyre depot was local and efficient.
The service was excellent from ordering the tyres to fitting.
Have previously used [REDACTED] since retiring (used to use Tyre Fitters just a few minutes from work place). You have to search through the offers to find the cheaper tyres (if you so wish) - but at least you have all the info re. ratings etc. Excellent service and otherwise easy to arrange. No hassle from having to ring round for quotes and fitting dates. I had an appointment set up within 48 hours - all went as smooth as 'clockwork'.
"First rate service. The best price on the internet, fitted at a decent local garage. Could not be happier! Thank you [REDACTED]."
"It was very good, I had a confusing email otherwise great."
Not an expert on tyres but the drive is good and good grip in the rain
"Easy, convenient and efficient, will most definitely use again!"
"Process worked well, including reminders of appointments, tyres arrived in time and all at a good price."
"[REDACTED] is a great way to get your tyres - good and efficient system. However, take care to check out the fitting centre before you arrange to have them fitted, as from experience, the standard is not always what I am sure [REDACTED] would expect. Avoid ATS Trafford Park at all costs."
"Made clear on tyre specs so easy to choose the right one for you. order, to deliverary, to fitting all very clear and most importantly, competitively priced."
Great service and quick a*
"Honest, reliable, hassle free, good quality and quick delivery."
"Great. There was a short technical delay in my new tyres getting to the garage I requested, but this was handled very well by [REDACTED] and the garage (Motorworx garage Ltd, Anniesland) we‚Äôre very professional."
"The whole process of choosing, ordering and completing could not be easier."
"Friendly, efficient, good all round job."
Very good and quick service and good price. The garage gave excellent service.
"Cool guys, good pricing and cooperation with fitters who come home to you..."
First class service. Fast efficient and clean.
I used [REDACTED] for the first time recently. My experience was completely positive. from the web portal to my experience irl at the garage. No hidden extras and a very professional service at Autowise. I would recommend them both to anyone.
"Great service from [REDACTED] and Tennyson Tyres, Holbeach."
The online ordering system is very straight forward and the prices are competitive. Staff at the garage are very helpful and friendly. Very pleased will all aspects of the service.
Good service. Discount and easy to organise
Great service. Simple to use.
Blckcricles are brilliant however the garage is not recommended at all
GreT company very easy to deal with and great value
"Great value, easily accessible location and very pleasing results. Thank you"
"Fitter left a scuff mark on my lovely alloy wheel, hopefully it will polish out. But that apart very good service."
I was extremely happy with the ease of ordering the tyres through to the proffesional of the fitting and explanation of tracking in a way which I could understand yet not feel patronised
"Very easy to replace my tyre, easy to get an appointment at the garage, reception was friendly, appointment was accurate. Quality of tyre as expected. Thank you"
Excellent prices & service.
"Good web site and price,efficient fitter,would recommend."
"Great service, I’ve been using the tyre fitting garage for years, excellent service and knowledge"
"Easy, no hassle, simple to use, decent prices, will be sure to use again!"
Own brand recommendation was excellent!
"Excellent, helpful service at a good price."
"I like using [REDACTED]. Excellent choice of tyres, keen prices, and the garage I use (Pemco Pitstop) is punctual and friendly.Well done!"
"Ease of use, quick and best price"
as stated above
Excellent and efficient
"My experience reflects more the fitting of tyres and not [REDACTED] . I had a fitting booked for 10.30am at fomula one tyres in bury st edmunds last friday, on arrival i was greeted well and informed they were running approx 20 mins behind,which wasnt a problem as i wasnt waiting but going to do some work a few hundred mtrs away. I left my contact details and was assured that it would be ready by lunch time . I heard nothing, so turned up at 2pm expecting new tyres on my car , however it hadnt been moved at all . At reception they apologised cos they just didnt have time to do my car, but they would have it done by 2.30 . I finally got my car with new tyres at 3.30 pm , some 5 hours after i left it. Despite leaving my contact details i never had a call forwarning me of any delay . [REDACTED] did deliver on time but were severly let down by your fitting parner . I will def order and reccomend [REDACTED] but would chose an different company to fit them ."
Good price and very convenient. Not a problem at all. Would recommend.
"I've been using [REDACTED] for years. Even though a few garages that fit [REDACTED] tyres have offered me the same tyres at a better price, I still use [REDACTED]. The reason being is they never offered me this price when I called the first time. Always shop around. It takes time but if you want to save money it's the best thing to do, but if it's a matter of a couple of pounds I try to be loyal."
8.30 Appointment but car not started until 9.00.Apart from this I am happy with the experience.
"Very good website, good selection of tyres to choose from. Speedy arrangement with selected garage."
"Used a few times now, tyres I bought were cheaper than the actual garage that fitted them, convenient buying process & cashback available if you use those sites, definitely my 1st go to now"
Excellent. Had to cancel order because my tyre didn't need replacing and they refunded with no questions asked.
could not have been simpler
"Excellent choice, price and service."
Great choice and very easy. Bond Street did a great job fitting.
"They are usually very good, but my tyres didn’t arrive for my original date to be fitted so I had to rearrange when they had arrived."
"Very good service from [REDACTED], delivered to the fitting garage on time........this time as the last time I ordered tyres only one was sent to the fitting garage. Otherwise good service thanks."
Tyre Fitter not Informed of Booking. I made an online booking through [REDACTED]. When I arrived at the confirmed time the tyre fitter had no record of the booking and could not fit the tyres that day. According to the tyre fitter this is a common problem and the fourth time that week that [REDACTED] has failed to inform them of a booking. Next time I will buy tyres directly from the fitter and make an appointment in person.
Great service and good price
"It's easy to use. It suits me to browse and find what I want. I can then have the tyres fitted at the venue I choose, aided by the recommendations on the site and then have them fitted at a time that suits me."
"Very good service, no waiting, The tyres are waiting for you. Will always use this service in the future."
Excellent pricing on quality tyres..excellent service.have used many times
Good price on tyres. Could fit me in within two days of order. Mobile tyre fitter was at my house 10 mins earlier than expected. Fitter was friendly and knowledgeable and a geral all round nice bloke. Definitely recommend.
Good deal and no issues with fitting.
All was as simple as clicking the house! Garage were great and very polite a great all round service
Fantastic service!! I ordered my tyre online and booked it to be fitted at my local garage. I dropped my car off on a Saturday morning and they called me less than an hour later. Perfect efficient service.
good efficient ervice
"The fitters had not had a confirmation of the booking and so I had to return in the afternoon to get the tyres fitted. No one answered the phone or replied to my email at [REDACTED]. There are other online tyre retailers, and I intend to use them in the future."
"Great service, great price and easy"
"Good range of tyres, competitive prices (I also got a 10% discount on 4xMichelins) and delivery/fitting went exactly as planned."
"The price was great but . The price was great. I was a bit concerned over whether the right tyres had been ordered. The fitters, Harris Bros, said that I should have had a different version of the tyre ordered. Also I have noticed that the fitters check tracking and ask if you need it altered - at a price. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the standard price or whether it is a higher price because the service was provided through [REDACTED]. I‚Äôm not sure if I would use [REDACTED] again. I will try foing dirwct to the fitters next time."
Great first time experience Really happy with the service I received Great prices Happy to use them in future
"Excellent. No issues at all with service, costs were competitive, product was as ordered. Will use again"
Great way of purchasing tyres and get them fitted. Very straightforward.
No issues at all with fitting and tyres are very well priced
"Failed visit - Arrived at the booked garage only for them to say that the tyres hadn’t arrived so car had to be booked in again. Communication was poor, long wait on phone (gave up after 30mins) and 24hr delay via email. Eventually sorted and 2nd time went well with no issues. Used BC in the past and have been good. The booked garage is also known to be poor and blamed BC but not 100% sure who’s fault this was. Communication from BC was poor for 2019.."
"Quick, easy, no hassle, competitive price I will use them again"
next time i need tyres [REDACTED] will be the first and only place i will go.
"It's a cheap, easy way to get quality tyres and fitted at work so no wasted time"
"Always the best price and most convenient times and places available for fitting, I always use [REDACTED]"
"I had 4 tyres fitted as well as tracking done and all completed in good time while I waited, I found the staff helpful and polite."
easy to deal with will use again
Great website. Makes it so much easier getting my tyres delivered on a time and date that's suitable to me.
Fantastic experience. Ordered online and new tyre was at garage ready to be fitted within a few days. Excellent service and will use again.
"Excellent service, used home fitting - £6! brilliant value for money Can highly recommend this overall service."
Whole system worked really well. Saved £20 per tyre fitted.
Payment taken twice due to errors in [REDACTED] online payment system which then caused problems with credit card. Process needs changes. Tyre service fine.
Great value and choice - and so easy to use
Straightforward transaction
Tyres cheaper than anywhere else. Fitting station did a first class job. Excellent customer service.
Had Tudor car Service fit tyres excellent job all went smoothly and on time
Good price for the tyres and great service from the garage fitting them. Simple from start to end.
"I have already submitted a reviewThe product is excellent , the price and service were very good"
Good website. Gives clear honest information to help the customer make an informed decision. Tyres arrived on time at local garage who were very helpful and friendly when fitting the tyres
Perfect thank you
excellent service. Did what it said on the site tyres at fitter when we arrived and quick service from fitting station
"[REDACTED] price and customer care are excellent. Even after my wheels were damaged by one of their approved fitters, [REDACTED] dealt with the issue efficiently and helped me to get my wheels repaired without a major fuss and also not having to go through their original fitters. Communication throughout was excellent. I would certainly recommend [REDACTED] and would use them again, although not with that particular tyre fitter. Thanks"
"Could not be more simple. Order on line through good website, book your fitting time, turn up have a coffee while the job is done, say thanks very much and go home. Easy Peasy."
"Really easy and affordable.Guys were helpful and friendly. Will definitely use [REDACTED] again, a hassle free way to get new tyres fitted."
"Fantastic service , very efficient and lovely staff👍🏼😃"
"Very easy website to use. Selecting the correct tyres at a fair price and arranging the fitting at a convenient day and time, a very simple operation."
"Easy to use website, great tyre selection / prices and convenient fitting centres."
"The whole procedure was simply and effective, and the outlet that carried out the work were effective and timely."
Good service - tyres arrived quickly - tyres excellent - will be getting more from [REDACTED] as and when needed. Very pleased.
You don’t need to tread carefully with [REDACTED] tyres . They are the best value with the fullest range . You also get a timed appointment at a local tyre fitting service but best to check the day before as confirmation is sometimes delayed
Very good. Garage was excellent. Tyres arrived as organised.
"Great service, fast and efficient."
This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] and the service was brilliant at the chosen fitment centre. Thoroughly recommend them.
i was surprised and disappointed at the length of time it took to fit 2 rear tyres to my car. I left the car with the fitters 10 mins before the appointed time but it was 1 1/2 hours after the appointed time before my car was ready. Just as well I had no other appointments that day!I had no complaints with [REDACTED] but would certainly not use Autowise fitters again
Booking was cancelled 3 times by ats under various excuses
The garage service was bit disappointing. The service by [REDACTED] was excellent but the garage was bit disorganised and charged me an extra £5.00 for wheel alignment on top of the charges quoted on the [REDACTED] website which is not indicated but other garages were showing extra charge on the site.
All ran very smoothly and I felt I had received value for money
I have used this garage previously for fitting new tyres to my car and again was very pleased with the service. Given. This time it again provided a 1st Class service.
"First time order from [REDACTED].Tyres ordered fine and I was offered an or pm. Chose pm thinking it meant I could go anytime in the afternoon to get tyres replaced. Day later got email with time I was expected at fitters. Emailed back to say that I couldn’t do the time given due to work and that 4:30 to 6pm would be best if possible. Email came back later the same day with a 5pm time slot. Got to tyre fitters and they said they could not get wheels off to change tyres due to stripped locking wheel but key. Said they couldn’t do it as they closed at 6pm and it was now 5:45pm. They requested I get lockers removed and then come back. I asked about making another appointment and they told me it would be an issue holding the tyres or getting them fitted when I got back. The next day I was able to get one of the nuts off by myself but was unable to get other off. Went to another garage over weekend who got it off. Took car back to tyre fitters and they fitted new tryres without a problem. So moral of this story, check you locking wheel nuts before taking you car in to get the tyres replaced."
Delay with delivery by 1 week and poor and late communication letting me know and slow response with rebook in confirmation
"Really easy to use, great price and convenient fitting location and times."
Always my first step for tyres competitive prices and uses good garages. Can’t ask for anything else
"Legitimate site, used numerous times to get great rates on tyres"
"No problem at all. Really easy to find and choose tyres and fitting locations. All taken care of for me, just turn up, drop off and collect. Competitive price too and with good brands."
"Great service as paid for tyres, then [REDACTED] contacted me stating they may not be suitable.They sorted correct ones kept same time slot and honoured the discount from the time of purchase."
"Very simple, no hassle. Will definitely recommend and will be using again."
Good job. Winsford garage were excellent
"Great price, prompt service, Great tyres. Ones I bought were a repurchase, the original front two lasting 50000 miles and nearly 3 years, with the rear still going."
"Clear website does what it says and when it says, the fitters were also excellent"
"Great service and price, all you need really"
Excellent experience from website through to garage. Very competitive price
Excellent seller fast postage great price And very easy to do online
"Tyres were cheapest available. Booked into local Skoda Garage to be fitted, which they did on time and washed and vacuumed the car as well.Avon tyres fitted seem to be good.Wheel balancing is fine from low to high speeds.Very happy customer.Good service. Can’t fault it."
Very good tyres at competitive prices
Convenient and easy to order through [REDACTED]. Got the tyres fitted after two days of ordering and excellent service by the garage in fitting the tyres within an hour.
Excellent service By ST Tyres in Fraserburgh. Good price for tyres from [REDACTED]
Tyres were the best price I found come very quick and the fitting process was easy to arrange.
Excellent service with no hassle.
Good service done the job in quick time would recommend this garage also [REDACTED] easy to use can't go wrong really.
Always a straightforward experience with [REDACTED]. Garage was great too.
Customer service was very good and communicative. The special offers were also very attractive.
All went well and on time
"Great value, great service. Got them delivered and fitted locally the next day."
Easy to order and book a time that's fits around my schedule.
Great service at a great price
This is the third time I have been asked to review after forwarding two completed questionnaires.
Ordered tyres to be delivered to garage for fitting all went perfect with no problems.Would definitely recommend [REDACTED]
Excellent Service. Would recommend to anyone who buys tyres online
"Best prices compared to anywhere else. Original tyres, easy process, pay by card online, turn up to selected garage and have your tyres fitted. Simple and easy. Will be using again."
They make getting new tyres put on one's car about as simple as it is possible to make the endeavour. Everything is well laid out and explanatory information is made easy to access. I've used them on four separate occasions already & will undoubtedly return again when next I need new tyres for my car.
Unbelievably easy process to order a new set of tyres specifically for my car. Can’t fault that service from the garage and the price won’t be beaten anywhere else.
"Easy process , buying tyres cheaper and choosing a garage that’s convenient"
Would recommend great service and it doesn’t take long to get them changed
"Good price, prompt delivery, good service from their fitters. All you could ask for."
The tyre selection section on the website is very user-friendly. The actual transaction was seamless. A good list of options on fitting centres. Very decent prices for decent rubber.
"Easy to use. Easy to book. Competitive pricing,"
Great price and all done without a hitch. How it should be.
"good price, plenty of selection, local garage."
Great value and good proffesional service from both [REDACTED] and ats who fitted the tyres. The tyres i origanly ordered where out of stock so [REDACTED] contacted me with an appropriate alternative and was still able to have them fitted at the time i had already booked. Havd used [REDACTED] before and would certainly use them again.
"Got exactly what I wanted for an excellent price. Everything was as promised, what more can you ask for."
It was easy and straight forward to organise.
Very quick and easy to use. Brilliant price.
Excellent in every way..!
the order lasted a long time and the garage did not make me wheel swing
"fine - all went well. the tyre fitters did a good job I left my car and came back later, no problems"
Very good. Job well done
"By far the greatest customer service I have ever received! The team is incredibly supportive and quick to respond, even though there was some issues (my own fault) these guys were fantastic to respond and quick to resolve them!"
This is the second time I've used [REDACTED].Previously I booked to have my tyres changed at a local garage but I noticed it was only a few pounds more to have them come to my house.I needed the same tyres so used the option in my orders (in Account) to repeat my previous order which saved me time and effort.Found the whole process straightforward and cost effective.The guy who arrived to change my tyres was super friendly and efficient.
Very convenient and easy to purchase and get fitted at garage.
Very straightforward ordering process and great value considering the fitting and balancing is included. Simply show up to your selected local garage at a date and time convenient to you.
"Good tyres, good price, lovely garage that fitted them. Would happily recommend!"
An extremely good range of tyres in all sizes at very good prices. Booking was very simple with a good range of local fitters with convenient appointments.
"Fast and easy service to use. Booked tyre after MOT advisory notice said I needed a new one. Recently had an issue and bought a tyre off the shelf from National Tyres. They charged me £180 for tyre, fitting and front tracking. Daylight robbery when [REDACTED] charged me just £60 for Tyre and Fitting. Separate four wheel tracking option was also available too."
they provided the best deal
No issues great price
"Brilliant, no hassle."
Good prices great service.
Tyres ordered online easily and with no problems.Had to call and change delivery address and that was done with ease.Will definetly use [REDACTED] again
So easy. Best prices I could find after numerous internet searches. Simple purchasing process. Had never heard of Rotalla. Proof will be in the pudding....
Most competitive price at the time of purchase. Unfortunately I had to wait a week as the tyres I had chosen were not in stock.
"fantastic tyres , highly recommended"
So easy and quick to organise online.
Really good company to use and good value
"Very quick & simple, & good quality tyres at very good prices well done"
"[REDACTED] is a great service, but don’t take the recommended tyre size, I done this and wrong tyres were sent to the garage. It’s worth getting the size from your car. To be fair to [REDACTED] I phoned them and they sent someone to pick up wrong tyres and offered me £20 off the correct tyre as it was quite a bit more expensive. But the person I spoke to was very polite and helpful."
"I had my tyres fitted by one of the approved garages, Formula One, in Newport Pagnell. The tyres were fitted, no problem, but when returned to my car the drivers seat was dirty. I went straight to the office to say it looked like they had sat in the car in dirty overalls. He came and looked at the seat and asked me where the mark was and I said it was all over. He acted like he couldn't see anything but it was obvious that the seat was dirty. He also said that their staff always put a cover on the seat. He did ask if I wanted them to vacuum the seat and I declined and asked if I could have a protective cover for the seat and I would sort it out myself. I was not happy with the way I was treated like I was seeing things and do not feel my complaint was handled correctly. I will not be using them again. This is not Black.Circles fault but makes me think twice as this garage is supposed to be a trusted trader for them."
Good service.
Excellent value for money and first class service every time. If you want to cut your motoring costs then this is the tyre company to use. A great range of budget to performance tyres for all your needs. Highly recommend!
"Why not try to experience great money saving adventure for choosing right tyres with reasonable comparison with other top branded products. I like the option for tyres and details for picking exactly right choice considering this and that. However, the fitting time took more than 1hour even if it seems simple to work. The reason was my car was abandoned more than 30 minutes as the priority of their work was not mine. It could be the only problem of joint business with other garage. But I was so happy that I fully enjoy the new tyres."
"The bloke who fitted the tyres was great - turned up on time - knew his stuff - no problem at all there.They quote an all-inclusive price for fitted tyres so I was a bit niggled to find that when their website advertises X% off it means X% off the tyres and 0% off the fitting (even though they don't actually split the price between tyres and fitting) so it cost me a couple of pounds more per tyre than it led me to believe. Yes, I know what it says in the (very) small print but when it says ""discount"" in size 60 font and ""subject to terms and conditions"" in size 6 font and you can only find the terms and conditions in the bottom of locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a notice on the door saying ""beware of the leopard"" it doesn't quite give the impression that you'd expect of a straightforward business. I'd rather they gave a smaller % discount honestly applied to the whole price."
"Purchased two new Michelin run-flat tyres and selected a fitting date with my local garage all through the [REDACTED] website securing a great deal with a 10% flash sale discount. However, a day before the fitting I was told the tyres were not available and offered a pair of Pirelli’s for the same price. I would have liked the option of my preferred Michelin not available at time of the purchase or not available on the website. As I wanted the Michelin I declined and opted for a refund. This did not materialise within the 3-5 days. A quick email after that period fixed that problem and money back in account 3 days later. It happens. Definitely will use [REDACTED] again as their a great company. As for the fitter they were fine but took ages to fit the two tyres. I dropped car off at 8am and earliest I could get it was 2pm. I had booked a early morning appointment. Oh well."
choice and price excellent and prompt delivery
"Replaced tyres at the recommended garage. Document (tyre check sheet?) said all tyre pressure were 2.3 bar however, 1 tyre pressure was so low when I picked up the car. I went to another garage to fill air. Do not believe what those documents says!"
Really easy to order tyres. The system told me which tyres I needed for my car and then I could choose whicj budgets to spend. Then they even offered a home change so they actually sent someone out to fit them! Couldn't have asked for better! Sam
Good price tyres Local garage to fit ok .... but couldn't find the locking wheel nut when it was in its proper place in the car!!
"Good price but I took off a star because the fitters I chose, ATS on kedleston road in derby, took an hour and a half from my appointment time to fit 2 front tyres."
I had to change x 2 tyres urgentlywas very pleased to find a contractor who came to my home address first class job.Had the wheels balanced on Saturday would recommend them without hesitation
Straightforward and simple. Convenient too. No hassle fix. Thanks
"Pretty poor experience overall. [REDACTED] delayed my tyres by a few days beyond when it was agreed they would be fitted. When tyres were eventually fitted they were the wrong size and having driven my car, I damaged my two alloys. Nothing was offered by way of compensation other than the meaningless ‘sincere apologies’. They did offer to fix my alloys and have them them re cut (which I have to organise and submit quotes etc) but nothing else. When the correct tyres were due to be fitted they again delayed the order and I’m hoping (but not holding my breath) that the correct tyres will be fitted tomorrow. I’ve had my car sitting in my drive for several days waiting for [REDACTED] to rectify their error. I hoped putting a customer out by a week might concern them but it really doesn’t. In summary they put themselves forward as a friendly, quirky service with their customer servers and personal bios stating they live in Edinburgh and enjoy watching TV, spending time with family and hillwalking. While they enjoy things like this, it’s pretty clear they don’t give one care about providing a good service and carrying out a simple task such as delivering and fitting a tyres. I will never be using them again. If you live in the Highlands just go anywhere else, regardless of the cost. These guys are just absolutely useless."
"Great prices, easy ordering and brilliant service."
"Easy to book, fair price, everything very simple at the garage.Good choice of garages in my local area"
Chose the tyres i wanted and had them fitted locally within a few days.Convenient and reasonably priced ~ what's not to like!
excellent quick service will use again
"Very friendly, fast and efficient."
Quick and efficient service. Any problems were resolved. Friendly customer service.
"I got quotes from a couple of tyre companies and then ordered the same size tyres from [REDACTED] saved £50 . Then had them fitted at the same place I got a quote from , when I arrived I was informed that there was a 45 minute delay. In all I was there about 2 hrs. Apart from that I don’t have any problem with the service provided"
"Service, price"
i have allready filled in a review afew days after tyre fitting
"Dependable service, good prices, quick respons"
Great service. Hassle free from start to finish and the tyres were much cheaper too!
"Great Site, easy to use. Good deals on tyres garage was really good. Would happily recommend and will use again"
"Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone. The whole experience from the very beginning was structured;efficient,courteous and the feedback that I received in the form of tracking of my order was outstanding."
Ordered the tyres online and pick the garge of my choice from the list provided which was only 1mile away.on.the day the staff at the garage were helpful and comlepted the work on time.so easy will alway do it this way.
Great website and informative. Good setout.
I found the website easy to use. I had my tyres of choice at a good price. Overall I found the experience very easy and received excellent service at the garage of my choice.
Best prices. I've always used [REDACTED]. Never been disappointed. They have the best prices. Fitting services always close by.
"good serviceonly issue I would state it that you cannot book and exact timeslot when ordering. the exact time is emailed later which is not ideal. e.g. I got a mid morning slot, whereas if I booked with Kwik Fit I could request a 9am slot. (and the cost difference was £2 so no real difference)"
Excellent service. Very professional. Would definitely use again and recommend.
"5 stars: Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone."
They should have a responsiblity to take away businesses that make you wait an hour and a half for 4 tyres that were booked in via the 'select a time' tab. You might aswell leave your car at this particular garage all day. Don't waste your time using this middle man style system.
"[REDACTED] itself is ok but the service station I opted for - ETS Euoromaster Stirchley - has no concept customer service and lack professionalism. I was there to replace one tyre. In that time, my car seat positioned was changed, my heating was on full blast even though it was a nice sunny day.If I had not looked in my boot, I would have lost my clip.They have no concept of service with a smile"
Spot on. Easy to order. In and out at the garage in an hour.
Great choice and prices with local fitter along with simple to book.
Buying and fitting couldn't be easier.
"was recommended by a friend. really good website, easy to chose the right tyre, good range of tyre options and prices. booked in at my local garage and had them fitted all without a fuss. would definitely use again."
"I used [REDACTED] to buy my present tyres and was enormously impressed at the cost and service.I discovered a slow puncture recently and ordered a new tyre. I turned up for the subsequent fitting appointment, but didn’t end up needing the new tyre as it turned out I had a damaged alloy.I rang up [REDACTED] after this and they refunded me the entire tyre & fitting cost with no quibbles. Very very impressed with the service and cannot recommend them highly enough."
"Excellent prices on premium brands, around £30 cheaper than the next best all inclusive price for a pair. Fitted locally by Savoy Tyres who were very prompt and helpful. Cannot fault the price or service. Very pleased indeed. Thank you."
"Website easy to use, garage that fitted the tyres were really professional and fitted them quickly."
2nd time I have used [REDACTED]And both times the service and product Have been 1st class
Used before and never disappointed. Super easy and the best value.
"Great service, and a wide choice of tyres found. Would use again.Personnel at the service centre were very accommodating allowing me to change my appointment slot to suite me better."
"Fair price, good service and all worked as expected. Be helpful to know how long appointments will take- especially for multiple tires."
Great service and brilliant price plus delivered on time
Excellent price and tyre choice. First class fitting.
"Great service and, more importantly, great prices!"
"Super easy to book, really recommend"
"Always good value, easy to order, and everything works exactly as it should."
"Good service, staff very pleasant, job well done."
easy to deal with
"Excellent service, very reasonable price."
Excellent price and service. The communication was very good and I would recommend to anyone.
Absolutely fantastic price for my two new tires. Fitted at a local garage too
"Good price, quality tyres and Frank Shaikley Colchester provided excellent customer service fitting."
"My original order was for the wrong tyre size. When I realised and contacted the company, the agents I dealt with were most helpful in getting the order right and re-arranging an appointment."
"Excellent price, easy site to use, very easy process and brilliant customer service. Can't fault it!"
"First rate service. Excellent communications with client. Fitting service also excellent and fitted at the time of appointment, no hold ups. Pleasant and efficient staff."
"Great service will used again. Great service, a good price, easy to order and the fitter had the tyres ready. No issues. We've used [REDACTED] before."
"I booked up for the vehicle health check when originally booked via the [REDACTED] website.On arrial at my chosen tyre centre, they were unaware of my request for a vehicle health check.Poor communications between [REDACTED] and my chosen garage."
Excellent ......... ATS fitted the tyres and were great as well.
Prompt professional service
another hassle free painless transaction
Cheaper prices and a painless experience to get a quote and arrange local fitting.
"AWFUL GO ELSEWHERE BAD COMMUNICATION ALWAYS CANCEL YOUR APPOITMENTS. My appointments got cancelled four times, I was told my tyre would be in stock by a certain date, then it was, then it wasn’t, then it was, then it wasn’t, they messed me around and I needed my tyre changed for a certain date because I needed my car to go away, I told them this and they promised me it would be done by the date I needed it to be done but it was not, it was such an inconvenience for me and I could of gone else where and had it done quicker! When I complained they then only gave me 10% off my NEXT purchase when they should clearly know there it will not be a next purchase, I wanted money off my current purchase but they said no for a reason they couldn’t explain, the communication was awful, I was emailing them and getting a new person reply to me each time not knowing what was going on, I had to repeat myself so many times when it should be their job to read back on pervious emails. Safe to say I will not be using them again! GO ELSEWHERE."
"Very easy to use web site. Tyres great value for money, next day fitting and a good range of local tyre fitters where you can pre book a fitting time.Used before and will use again"
"Have used this company twice now, no problems occurred, prices reasonably cheaper than other options and fitting appointments worked out well."
"Everything went a smoothly as it could possibly go, ordered numerous tyres now and every time is as good as the last.Thx [REDACTED]"
"Very easy transaction from start to finish. Good choice of products, excellent value and service."
"Excellent service and price, would recommend"
Excellent and quick service. Very pleasant staff too.
"Great, this must be the easiest way to buy tyres at very competitive prices, I even got 10% off with a special offer. The fitting company, ATS Dorchester were also excellant."
Efficient and perfect service
Great service as always!
Another easy tyre purchase from [REDACTED]. Fitted locally and all at a good price
good reliable and realistic prices
"Competitive pricing, excellent service"
"I needed two Michelin Tyres and after checking local suppliers, [REDACTED] came out the cheapest. The Tyres were delivered on time and the center I chose to have them fitted were very good. I am very pleased with my purchase."
Competitive prices. Easy transaction and choice of location for fitting.
"Great service, choice, and communication prior to appointments for fitting. Definitely recommend."
Very happy with the service and price never knew it would be so easy to do online .
"Great price on Michelin Pilot Sport 4s tyres for my Focus RS. Fitting at Merityre in Bagshot was first rate, too."
Great service good delivery and a nice tyre fitter
Fast & efficient service. Will use it again in future if needed!
"First time I’ve used [REDACTED], great prices and ATS Uttoxeter were fantastic."
Great service friendly and helpful
Unbeatable prices and hassle free. Would use again.
good price and great service from the chosen to garage.
Good selection of products at competitive prices.Local fitters.
The website is great as you can choose exactly the tyres you want without having to make do with what your local fitter has on the shelf.
"Good price, beat all the local tyre suppliers particularly because there was a special weekend discount. I chose a local garage to fit them, they contacted me to tell me when, I turned up on time and they were fitted straight away. However, probably because tyre fitting isn't the garages main business, I then had to go to a specialist for re balancing. So I would recommend [REDACTED] for supplying but choose a proper tyre place for fitting and balancing."
"Good pricing, fast service, tyres fitted on my drive by efficient & friendly fitters. Good job."
Easy to use and great value
Great service from [REDACTED] but let down by ATS - failed to spot significant issue with rear suspension when changing tyre - Vehicle failed MOT an hour later. Will go back to using Mr Tyre for the fitting.
"Easy to use website, easy way to buy tyre's and get them professionally fitted at a very competitive price.Always use [REDACTED] and always will for both the cars in our family"
Very competitive prices with a great range of tyres. Excellent service at fitting agent. Have used [REDACTED] before and would have no hesitation using again.
First class yes I will go there again
"Very pleased with the customer experience. Tyres were easy to order online, obtained a good deal on Michelin Crossclimates and C&A Autocentre, Inverkeithing were quick / efficient with fitting. Only piece of feedback would be a coffee machine in the waiting room would have been welcomed!"
"A very pleasant experience when dealing with [REDACTED]. I made a mistake on my order & and the team pick-up on it and contacted me to advise I had selected a different tyre for my car this time. I reviewed my order to clarify that this was the case, they where correct. I spoke with one of the support team and we had the order corrected the same day."
Thanks very pleased. Quality service and product at a cheaper price.
Fitted by Elgin Motors in Rosyth. Great service and reasonable price.
Excellent service would come back
Normal. professional service...as it should be 😊
"Quick & Easy to use, great price and garage used was very quick, friendly & efficient.Will use again"
Excellent prices and booking system
"Everything went to plan, the date, the time and carried out by professional staff"
Great customer service
Excellent service and brilliant prices
Had tyres I wanted for a reasonable price. Local garage could fit them. No problems with fitting. All good.
"No phoning around to find the best deals and booking appointments etc, it's all there on one page, Brilliant!"
"Purchased on the behalf of a vehicle workshop. Order placed on Monday at 11.55am for 2 tyres at over £400, promised delivery of Tuesday next day. I received an apologetic email and a voicemail outside of office hours at 5.35pm Monday, that stated the tyres would not arrive Tuesday but Wednesday instead. Contacted [REDACTED] on the phoneline on Thursday PM after realising that we had not yet had a delivery. The call handler explained that there had been a courier issue and that the tyres could not be supplied until the following Monday, 7 days after initial order. They were apologetic that I had not been contacted but couldn't offer an explanation as to why I was not informed that delivery would be delayed. Although the call handler was apologetic, it was explained that these tyres were for a client vehicle and had caused a delay in it being returned to the customer. I was offered 10% discount on next order, which I did not accept. As a gesture of goodwill it is lovely but doesn't help with the current issue & let down client. I have now sourced the tyres elsewhere, which have been delivered on Friday (today). It has taken 13mins on hold at peak time to cancel the order, (please change the on hold music :) !) but credit to both call handlers who chased the order, courier, and cancelled the order. Both very professional and did their best to assist. Just a shame that we haven't been looked after as a business in this instance"
"Once again I was very impressed with the service, and value for money. The Dunlop Sport Maxx I have just put on the front of my BMW X5 are great, a softer ride and improved handling."
"Great value service - no frills, but polite service and done to a good standard."
great pricedelivery date later than promisedkept informed about the above
"All good.... VERY good.Great price, great service from their garage partners.Will use again."
"I have used [REDACTED] a few times, good prices and convenient service."
Very good ordered on Thursday night fitted Saturday morning price was very good the garage was waiting for me to arrive excellent service
"Great service by the guys who changed the tyres, shame the man in reception wasn’t friendly, he needs to go on a customer service course! Apart from that all good."
Can't fault anything..first experience of an online tyre purchase and already amazed on how easy was it. Only help could be to get a slightly sooner date for fitting. Had also used that flash sale offer so happy overall.
Very good price and easy to choose fitting time and date very good quality contáis on my mercReally pleased
Excellent price and the service at the garage where I had them fitted was brilliant
Hassle free. Ordered online they get delivered and fitted at destination of your choice on date suits you. Couldn’t be better.
No issues or problems with order and fitting service.
A fair price and the work completed at my chosen dealershipGreat
Ordered for fitting a week ahead but they cancelled at last minute due to no stock. Useless
Always a convenient and easy way to purchase tires.
"Tyre's for my car are none standard, Forums reporting issues getting hold of them. No such problem at [REDACTED].Great fitting service at Hi-Q in Mansfield.Great price good standard of service and I will be using again."
Great experience and highly recommended
Clear instructions to follow. Quick and easy. Pricing in line with market.
"Brilliant company. Quick, easy & great price 👍🏻"
"Easy to search for tyres. One of the cheapest dealers online. Simply choose a garage for fitting, pay and get yhem fitted when convenient. Spot on."
Good quality tyres at a competitive price. The entire process was very simple and I would use [REDACTED] in the future.
"Booked and paid for 2 tyres to be fitted at my place of work a couple of days later and was given an am appointment. I waited all day and nobody showed up, a complete waste of time and effort. I did get a refund after waiting 25mi s on the phone, and after speaking to the customer service person, I felt tbat my custom didn't matter. Would never use again or even tell anybody I know of their existence.P.s. only gave 1 star as I couldn't give 0 stars."
"Nothing really to complain about, a faultless service."
Straight forward and excellent service.No problems.
I booked my tyre change for a complete set of tyres for an Aston Martin DB9. The appointed garage was excellent and the service was superb. My complaint is that the tyres I received were date stamped 2017 therefore were at least 2 years old. Upon complaining about this to [REDACTED] directly I was informed that these tyres are not pressed often and therefore up to date tyres could not be guaranteed. Unfortunately due to time commitments I was unable to reschedule my fitting and had to go ahead with the 2017 tyres. The car does not do a big mileage and therefore I have paid for tyres that are already at least two years short on their life cycle due to the natural degradation of the rubber compound. Not too happy with [REDACTED] at the moment.
"[REDACTED] are so easy to deal with, they send out all the confirmation paperwork ETC very promptly, and are also great value."
"Convenient, quick, reliable"
Trouble free
Efficient order procedure and kept me informed of fitting.Garage fitting was also very local and good.Could not fault the service and the 10% flash sale was a great bonus.Will not hesitate to use again
"Good Clear Service. Good, prompt service.Probably best retail prices. Local tyre fitters could be better rated"
Good value tyres fitted quickly & efficiently at a friendly & helpful supplier.
"A quick, easy and efficient service online to order and pay for tyres. I ordered 4 and had them fitted trouble-free within 3 days at a convenient local garage. Would highly recommend [REDACTED]."
Excellent very straightforward. And Fort street motors were excellent
"Competitive prices, great service & fast fitting time highly recommend as a returning customer"
"Good price and quick service, can't fault, thank you."
Good No problems!
Very easy transaction selecting tyres and fitters. But I needed a full set of tyres so didn't mind waiting a few days before they were fitted - not sure what would happen if I needed a new tyre straight away.
No problems. Everything as expected.
"Booked an appointment at a local garage via [REDACTED]. Was then told it was unavailable and was changed to another, supposedly in 'my area'. It wasn't but i made plans to get there anyway. This was then also cancelled and i was finally given another garage which was a further 10 miles away and troublesome to get to due to renowned traffic in the area. Got fitted ok. Complained about the experience with [REDACTED] and was offered a discount and minor compensation. This was 2 weeks ago and still not heard anything despite a number of emails sent. Very poor service."
"Good range of tyres, competitively priced, with clear total cost including fitting. Will be using [REDACTED] again next time I need to replace my tyres."
great price and very quick to organise
"Such an easy process to follow. Choose your tyres, pick the fitting location and time slot then pay. It's that simple! I arrived at my fitting location 'Brake & Service World - Letchworth' and they were ultra professional and my tyres were fitted at the exact booking slot time. Such an easy process which put you in control of the costs against turning up at a random tyre fitting company and feeling under pressure to purchase more expensive tyres you don't need. I won't be using anyone else but [REDACTED].com going forward."
My jaguar came back from the garage with break fluid leaking from the front of my car when I only had rear tyres fitted. The garage was more than helpful to sort things out however [REDACTED] promised that a manager would call me back about the complaint but I am still waiting a week later for this. Terrible customer service from [REDACTED] from now on I will use halfords or kwik fit as I have never had problems with them.
Fast efficient. No complaints
"Competitive price with the tyres being fitted at a local tyre garage.No hassle Appointment time convenient, 4 tyres fitted and balances in 60 min"
Great service and very competitive.. would recommend and will be using again
"Excellent service, no hassle and really easy to organise. Special mention to Jim Steel Garage in Beeston, Notts who carried out the fitting. Great job and with great timing.Highly recommend!"
"Tyres seem fine, but will need to check to see what Psi was put in them as didn't ask at the time"
No problems whatsoever! :)
"Competitive pricing.Website very easy to to use, buy and arrange a fitting appointment.Very helpful on the telephone.I very much recommend; in fact I am shortly going to buy two more tyres, come payday!!"
A good price saving on a runflat for my 320M Sport. Polite fitters who were waiting for me when I arrived for my 11.00a.m. appointment. The only hitch came from my bank’s website asking for my password verification when it would not return me to the [REDACTED] page. However I found a phone number and completed the order in just a few minutes over the phone. In another couple of months I’ll need two front tyres and will order from [REDACTED].
"excellent service at a good price and although I ordered the wrong size tyres they sent me replacements very quickly with no fuss. The girl I spoke to when I phoned to explain was so nice and helpful, a credit to [REDACTED]"
No nonsense simple to use website. Tyre fitter was no hassle too. Good Job.
Tyres from a reputable manufacturer at a reasonable price. Turned up at the appointed time at the fitting garage only to be told that they already had another fitting session arranged for that time so I had to wait just over an hour to complete the job.
very good service and price
"Easy, fast and convenient."
The ordering process is very easy to use and convenient. It allows you to book a fitting at the nearest garage. I placed the order on Wednesday for a Friday fitting. On Thursday afternoon I received an email stating there was an issue delivering my tyre to the garage and that my fitting was being rebooked to Tuesday. I had to phone [REDACTED] as I had already made arrangements and taken time off work to have the fitting on Friday. I am reliant on my vehicle for transport to work and of course this meant that I would be without a vehicle for another 4 days!. [REDACTED] were unable to keep the Friday booking and I was offered a small compensation by the rep on the phone. I kept the booking on Tuesday as the tyre which I ordered was only available through [REDACTED]. Come Tuesday there was no further problems the garage I chose was spot on. I awaited the compensation to be refunded back. Another week goes by and there was no sign of any compensation or any communication. So I rang [REDACTED] who told me there was no note on their system regarding me being given any compo.This was sorted the following day and I did receive the amount promised.Overall I would say this was a rough ride ordering from [REDACTED]. It's a shame they are failing at such little things and leave you stranded. The whole point of ordering a tyre from the internet is so that it is convenient and reliable. Unfortunately I can't say this about [REDACTED] at this point in time.If you are pushed for time I would rather recommend going to a local garage and pay the premium but get your tyres done the same day.
Would use [REDACTED] again. Excellent service. But wouldn't have ats inverness fit them. They said my wheel alignment was miles out but the tyres that came off where 2mm across the full tread and no shoulder wear. Think there trying it on
"on this occasion [REDACTED] let me down, numerous other times they have been outstanding. by not communicating with me I would have been left waiting for my tyres and would have lost money through no work. Autotest in Ewell were absolutely brilliant and contacted me as soon as the tyres were in and then fitted me in to fit them."
I've used [REDACTED] several times now and they are unbeatable. I always find the cheapest prices for the tyres I want and I can have them fitted by a tyre fitting establishment that I trust.
First class and hassle free.
"Had a couple of new tyres fitted at Shafton Garage Services last week and found the service absolutely first class. You won't be sold anything you don't need. Quick, efficient and very helpful. Would recommend to anyone in the area."
"[REDACTED] are so user friendly, from the straightforward website with competitive prices to the network of fitters who offer flexible fitting times and an excellent service. I would definitely recommend you try them."
everything went fine.
very goodwould have liked somewhere closer and a sooner available date
Good enough website. Delays in my order meant rescheduling of time off work which was inconvenient and garage itself was particularly unprofessional & useless
"Got shifted from one garage to another, which took me out of my way a bit, but Shire Hill Garage in Saffron Walden were friendly and efficient so no complaints. Saved about £50 (10%) on four tyres which is OK, so overall a good experience."
"Booked time was changed, If times are not available they need to be removed.Fittment was excellent and good advise on break pads."
"Well priced tyres fitted at my convenience, what’s not to like!"
Easy to use and garage nearby
Cheap n easy to use. Plus u don’t need to talk to anyone. Will use again
It would have been five stars but for the fact that the partner fitting centre said they hadn't received the tyres and that I couldn't check with [REDACTED] because they had gone home at 3pm on Saturday afternoon.
"Reviews of product, prices, ease of choosing where to fit. Super."
No fuss no hassle great site.
"Could not fault the service in arranging the time and my chosen fitment centre.East Bilney garage did a great job ,were on time and provided a comprehensive check list of brake pads and other areas which was an unexpected bonus."
"Used [REDACTED] for a number of years now, excellent service, prompt delivery and best price always. Combined with their choice of fitting agents (Hi Q in Chelmsford in my case) - what's not to like !!!"
"Having had a quote from the Service Station I use for car servicing, MOTs, etc. for two new tyres (termed as 'medium budget' tyres) I trawled the internet for alternatives and found well known brand tyres at a lower price via [REDACTED]."
"Good quick service, but snapped a bolt which is still stuck and going to cost me more money to fix..."
Easily arranged and Hi Q Plymouth very friendly and helpful
Took my car for tyres and very freindy and helpful
excellent service. no issues. Tyres fitted without delay and as described. I would use [REDACTED] again and recommend them to anyone looking for tyres at decent prices.
The tyres were delivered on time and the price was pretty good but I had to wait for them to be fitted another day as the centre didn’t have the staff to fit them at the appointment and hadn’t phoned me to say so
"Easy to get to, great service."
very competitive prices
Very easy to use and great prices too. Highly recommended.
Easy to order and online. Load's of tyre choices from premium to budget and ways to pay hustle free i would say.. definitely buying my next tyre to them...
"Easy to use site, good price."
can't fault the whole process
"the guy who came to fit the tyres at home was excellent, really friendly even though it was throwing it down, would definitely use the home fitting service again"
"Used a few times previously and never been let down. Fast, efficient and good value for money."
"Hassle-free, smooth experience: found easily the right tyre for my motorbike, got it delivered to a garage, went to the garage and got it fitted.Perfect."
"Excellent value for money and for customer care. I inadvertently ordered the invitrect size, but replacements were sent out and changed with no hassle or argument. All done and dusted within 48 hrs. Excellent Highly recommended"
I always use [REDACTED] and will continue too.
Everything it was nice the only comment i have is that in order to do the tracking adjasment they asked £60 while near by they ask £50 or less without earning fron the tyres.
"[REDACTED] used to offer to best price in the market and an accurate fitting time but not anymore!The prices have gone up considerably and the fitting times much more loosely offered.Also, to top it all, the fitter changed a perfectly good tyre with around 5mm of tread, ( it was partially my partners mistake as she mixed up near side and offside, but you would think the fitter would question it!!)The fitters were apparently pretty unfriendly and she didn’t want to go back to question their mistake.All in all I don’t think I will use [REDACTED] in the future, over the years I must have ordered 20 tyres for myself, friends and family so I was pretty loyal."
I saved a significant amount of money but had a wide choice of tyres whilst only having to wait a few days to have them fitted by a reputable company.
"Very happy with service, great prices and fast and easy to use service"
Great service and cheaper tyres why go with anyone else?
Fast fitting and friendly staff was my second vist and I will be back
Recommended. Great service all round.
"Great prices , great service!"
"Good price, tyres were delivered promptly to fitter who then fitted them within a couple of days as agreed."
Good value for money service
excellent service all-round
The website is very easy to use and I always find the price of tyres to be very competitive.It is easy to get an appointment with excellent local fitting companies at a time convenient to me
"Easy to find the preferred tyres for my car from a range of manufacturers and prices. Straight forward ordering and payment processes. My chosen fitter, Mr Exhaust Grimsby, did an excellent job as usual."
"Great service, quick and reliable, good quality tyres. Thank you"
"Easy purchase, tyres arrived at chosen fitting centre in good time, fitting centre busy but a good job was done"
1st time using [REDACTED] found it price competitive and really quick and efficient service
Fast and reliable service. I will use again.
"Great price, quick service"
Plzd with excellent service
Very satisfied
"Such a simple way of finding the most suitable tyres at a very competitive price. Gives the opportunity to compare the tyres with the standard ratings, with a good level of detail. Once you have selected, it’s just a case of finding a nearby fitter and booking a slot. Couldn’t be easier..."
We opted for the mobile fitting service and the mechanic could not have been more pleasant or helpful. Would have no hesitation in using them again.
Very pleased with service done a brilliant job word recommed to family and friend keep up good work
From start to finish this only took minutes and saved me a small fortune. Tyres were arranged to be fitted at my local ATS at a time and day suitable for me and they were really polite and respectful. In future I will always be buying my tyres through [REDACTED].com
"I've used [REDACTED] two times. Their website, choice of partners and service is great!"
Easy to order online and right tyres quickly available and fitted as agreed. Never going to those big companies again.
"Great, rapid service! Saved me a good £45."
"some confusion about the tyres arriving at the fitting centre on time,sorted after a phone call to the fitting centre"
all good with no problems
"Can't fault them. Good price, good tyres, good price. What else is there to say?"
"Best price online and garage chosen to fit tyres did a great job, I will definitely be a repeat customer and highly recommend."
"Excellent service, I would not hesitate to recommend. The staff at the partner garage for fitting were friendly and very helpful. Much appreciated thanks."
Just fantastic
"First class service,tyres arrived quickly. Michelin PS4. Price good. Excellent."
Easy to orderEasy to payEasy to book a slotEasy & quick turn aroundThe Full Package
Great staff great service Couldn’t be happier
Swift and competitive service
Excellent will defo use again
Good price. I had some trouble with the home fitting service not turning up and wrong tyres. They have m given me a discount after that.
Efficient service at a competitive price. You can also choose tyres that are not always available through from a chain tyre retailer
I researched the web for Dunlop SP Maxx and [REDACTED] was the best value bar none. I selected the fitting centre and was very pleased with the service so much so I will be using the fitting garage to provide ongoing maintenance for my car. Golden Barn Garage Henfield Sussex are a great Ambassador for [REDACTED] tyres. 5*
Good tires good price and fitted locally what more can you want.
First time using online to order new tyres will not be the last. Easy to do and cheaper than the high street. Great service from [REDACTED]
"This is a great idea, however having booked to go to one garage to get tyres fitted I got a message the following morning to say this garage could not do tyres until a later date which was unsuitable. After a couple of phone calls this was changed to another garage on the day I required."
Absolutely no problems at all.
"Great all round service with pricing to match, tyres were waiting when I arrived at chosen fitting centre, staff helpful and polite. Only minor criticism was the paperwork that needed to be completed whilst having tyres fitted, but Understand that things need to be done proper. Would use again especially when BC have promotions running, makes them cheaper than anyone else."
Very good price and service
First time I've purchased tyres online. Every aspect including organising delivery to my choice of fitting centre was undertaken with no hassle or hidden costs.The tyres are perfect.
easy to use website
"Easy to use website, best price by far and a choice of fitting options and garages which you just don't get everywhere else. Great customer service with immediate replies to emails."
Dates changed 3 times. Finally requested refund as was just being given the runaround
"Well managed, great communication and swift, friendly service provided by chosen garage."
Great tyres delivered swiftly. [REDACTED] admin staff were helpful in quickly sorting out a minor issue with the fitting garage
Got a great price on a new tyre. Tyre was fitted by local garage who were efficient and very helpful. Had to wait 4 days till tyre was fitted but wasn't a major as there was no desperate hurry.
Easy no fuss way to buy your tyres. Huge choice of price/brand.
"Tyres arrived on time, good price 👍"
"Dunlop Sportmax. Great price, service and most importantly, great tyres..."
"Best price for the tyre I wanted, fitted at a time and place convenient for me. Excellent service."
"The only way I'd buy tires now. Really quick and easy to register, choose your car and select from a wide range of tires. Choice of several local garages too, including the nearest one to my home. Good booking follow up/ reminder too."
I use [REDACTED] regularly and would not consider anybody else..
Another efficient service with good prices local to me with no waiting
"First class website, easy ordering, prompt delivery."
"Very efficient, fitting done at my workplace, all very painless, no problems, will do it like this next time. Couldn't be better."
"I would have given a top rating but was very disappointed to find that [REDACTED] were offering 10% discount on the same product 2 days later. My advice is don’t buy unless the tyres are on sale as the offers are regular. It has made me think twice about going back, particularly as a number of garages offer a price match......."
Brilliant service. Low prices . . Good customer service
As usual excellent price and service. Tyres are nearly £50 cheaper than my local garage each!
"Simple , straightforward, and I saved £50."
Rapid delivery . Very good service.I am a bit dissapointed that the ATS tyre garage has scratched two of my alloys .
Saved me £50. On four tyres good service
Excellent service. Tyres were ready on the day I selected.Good value for money. Would use them again.
Very happy with the tyres from [REDACTED] . Straight forward and fast delivery to the auto centre I chose . I would of given 5* but the auto centre said they hadn't received my booking slot but it was all sorted out on the day and the tyres feel great on the car . 🙂
Excellent service and very quick. I will definitely use [REDACTED].com in the future.
Good service & price
Very smooth transaction will use again
good bought at good fitted price
Great choice of tyres at great prices. Slight glitch this time as the tyres didn't arrive on time. I was notified in advance and had to rearrange fitting.
Can't fault the process or experience
Easy to use at s great price
Full service provided in spite of much of the city being closed due to nearly 4 inches of snow falling overnight. I actually got an earlier slot as a result. Quick and simple. thanks
Absolutely Brilliant value tyres fitted at our fantastic local garage.
Very convenient for the buyer and ATS who fit your tyres and prices are very competitive.
Excellent service would highly recommend
Great deal and fitting centre was excellent
"Competitive prices and good, convenient service"
"Bought a pair of motorcycle tyres. Very competitive price helped by a flash sale but what did impress was the speed of delivery, would definitely recommend"
The best companie with the best service!
"Would have liked a better range of tyre options for my car and maybe being able to search for a particular manufacture, otherwise can't complain."
"Was informed by [REDACTED] that I had an appointment at 11:45. When I got there on time, I was informed I had to wait for an hour. Apparently, the garage had told [REDACTED] it was an AM appointment."
"Good price, fast delivery."
Tyres are great value for money
Tyres themselves were fine but the tyre pressure sensor was broken and the garage was unable to fix so I had to buy a replacement from main dealer and then go to another tyre fitter to have sensor fitted and programmed costing extra.
"Always easy to use, good prices and the choice of where to have fitting done is ever increasing."
Very efficient service. Fitter turned up within the time given and took great care not to damage my newly refurbished wheels. Will definitely use the on-the-drive service again.
"First time we've used [REDACTED], a very efficient service all round.Excellent !!! thank you, Linda."
A good experience from start to finish.
Overall easy service and saved money which was a bonus
Easy and straightforward to use...good selection of tyres available..got my van booked in nxt day at nearest tyre fitters in my area
"Top rate, as usual."
"The tyre fitters started early and did a great job. The car was carefully jacked using a scissor lift and rubber pads. The right tyres fitted the right way round, pressured and torqued using a torque wrench. Always good to see. The only downside was the car was rear ended and written off 12 hours later. Will use [REDACTED] again on its replacement."
Nice idea but double check garage has equipment. It turned out that The garage selected didn‚Äôt have the equipment required to change the tyres. My husband ended up losing a day taking the car to a 2nd garage. There is now a clunking sound under the car - so will have to take it to a third garage to get this looked at.
"Efficient, Immediate and solid price. Many thanks. 😊"
Used [REDACTED] for years and have always had great service with no issues whatsoever. Always have a great choice of premium tyres available at competitive prices too.
Great service will be using them again
I was well impressed with the [REDACTED] service . I would use this service again .
great service and good prices
"Had the best prices out of all the choices I found, I chose the mobile service due to the car having a failed MOT. Was a bit shaky to begin with, having been told my appointment was unavailable and having a new date set - I didn't receive confirmation and was informed my request went to the wrong department.They arranged it once more and everything was fine, the mobile fitter got there as early as possible and were fast and polite.Overall a good experience, despite the hiccup at the start (which may not have been entirely their fault), the [REDACTED] staff were friendly and helpful.This service was perfect for my circumstance, just keep in mind urgent appointments probably aren't likely (at least, with mobile fitting)"
"Using website was easy and prices very competitive. Great selection of fitting sites near me and was able to book within two days. However I did receive an e-mail the following day advising the selected fitting time was no longer available. On contacting the customer service centre the staff were extremely helpful and offered to contact the fitting centre for alternative times, they called back within 5 minutes, fantastic customer service On arriving at the fitting centre they were waiting for me tyre fitted and no issues. Overall great experience would not hesitate to recommend."
"I suppose the only “complaint” is that I could not wait on site for the tyres to be done. The tyre fitter was busy, although I had arrived at opening hours on a Saturday morning on their recommendation and had to leave my car for three hours. It would have been acceptable if I had had a hard and fast appointment time.Otherwise the tyre changes were as expected. Two thumbs up there."
"Second time used, will continue to do so"
tyers no prob
"Quick, easy and efficient"
"Simple, easy and good value"
"The actual purchasing and delivery of my four new Cross climate tyres from [REDACTED] went smoothly enough. My problems started when the partner garage (Auto Pfect at Wath on Dearne) could not accommodate me on the date I booked on line and I therefore had to rearrange it and wait a further week as it needed to be a weekend. The tyres seemed to be fitted fine but I had to ask them to find my locking wheel nut key as it was not in the car. A few days later I took my car to the Kia dealership for mot and service. The car failed because the tyre on the rear drivers side had been fitted the wrong way round!! Apparently the tyres are directional. Kia sorted out the tyre for a cost and passed the car and the garage who fitted the tyres reimbursed me for that cost. I chose Auto Pfect because [REDACTED] rated them as a premium fitter, and despite the staff being friendly and generally helpful, the mistakes made were very basic and avoidable for a professional tyre fitting garage. I certainly wouldn't trust them to provide other services and will stick to the trusted main Kia dealer."
"The tyres I ordered were to be delivered Wednesday last week, however three arrived Wednesday and the remaining tyre arrived Friday. This was after my scheduled fitting and caused me to have to cancel and reschedule. One positive was the online chat which was very quick to respond although never delivered update emails promised on my outstanding delivery."
Good choice of tyres from cheap never heard of brands to the top of the shop branded ones. Good prices and a choice of garages to have them fitted.
Change of delivery and fitting was notified by email which went in Junk and it was only by luck that I noticed it.
Good and reliable.
Great prices and discount. Easy to use website and process.
"Good tyres, Good value and good service !"
"Very good website for new tyres. The first place I would go for prices. However, could you get cheaper tyres at Costco? However, that depends on whether you can get in there,"
Great service. Great price with a discount.
Very efficient good price great customer servoce
"easy ordering , delivery made to my local garage ( happened to be 5 min away and a premium one) rectified a mistake immediately (glitch on system for order) and re-arranged fitting direct with garage 😀great prices"
Ordered my tyres on a Wednesday night had them fitted on the Saturday morning. Great service with a saving of £50.
Spot on.. great choice of tyre's across the board!
Easy way to buy tyres at a fair price
"Easy to book and got my tyres fitted from a good local fitter,"
Excellent service at a great price. Very happy
Good information.Efficient service
Easy process to order tyres and arrange fitting. Prices were good. Fitting garage was quick and courteous. Overall a very positive experience.
Excellent in everyway.this is 3rd time.i have used them and recommended them 3times to family
"easy to use ,1st class service"
"Straightforward easy service to use, enter registration, select required tyres from the list of results. Could not be easier."
A great service which is so conveiniant to get tyres fitted for a very good price would definately recommend using the company.
"All in all a great service. There was a little confusion on the expected delivery times of my new tyre to my local garage. This confusion was caused by mixed messages in the emails from [REDACTED]. One email said that the tyre was going to be late and I needed to rearrange which I did. Then another email said the tyre would now not be late and the original time slot was still available. But I was not aware of this update until it was too late to confirm. A third email confirmed a new time slot -for a date that was yesterday! Obviously I challenged this and they then corrected the mistake. In the end the tyre change went well, no hiccups in the garage. Would still use [REDACTED] again, just wish for more clarity and less confusion in future."
Best service ever....arrived the next day
"Very easy to book on line, I needed to change the date which was sorted after a quick phone call."
Quick and easy ordering on line . Fitting arranged promptly and very local for me . Fitting service ( willow tyres in Crosby) very competent and friendly. Would recommend to anyone .
"Great price with 10% off all Michelin tyres. Had the tyres I wanted in stock, were delivered to my local tyre fitters.All a very painless process."
"Easy, straightforward and good value. Really appreciated the specified fitting slot at the garage."
Cracking service. No hassel at all
"Tyres weren't ready for the scheduled fitting date and at very late notice, after 5pm the day before that date ingot an email advising of a new fitting date two days later. Why couldn't you provide a reasonable lead time for the fitting date in the first instance"
Professional service from start to finish
My first experience with [REDACTED] very impressed with staff and service First class
All happened on time as described with a choice of 2 fitters in my very local area.
"I've given it 4 stars because [REDACTED] is easy to use and saves alot of shopping round, BUT, the fitting company I used, Wiltshire Tyre and Auto Centre in Melksham, was not very good at all. Ok, so, no attempt was made to cover up the seats or floor despite the fitter getting in my beautifully clean car wearing dirty clothes and muddy boots. The waiting room was filthy, you would walk out dirtier than when you walked in. Despite paying £250.00 for my tyres, a coffee whilst waiting still cost £1.00. When fitted, I was urged to sign the paperwork to confirm that I'd been offered a look at the car post fitting to make sure I was happy, but hadn't. no attempt was made to remove the mud that was now in my car and dust that was on the seats and other places after fitting.I would use [REDACTED] again , but will avoid this fitting centre at all costs."
[REDACTED].com are spot on.
Efficient and courteous.Our local garage McKinnons fittedGood price from [REDACTED]
"I used to swear by [REDACTED] and recommend them all the time. However, their service has gone down hill of late with two successive orders going wrong due to delivery issues, fitting appointments being double booked etc. For the sake of saving a few quid just go direct to ATS, I did, and the job got done where and when I wanted it."
"Easy, good price and service."
"Not great. I think I would have got a better service else where. I requested the garage to maintain my original Bmw metal dust caps but they didn’t, replying: they’re not original mate, so I didn’t bother. Regardless of whether he thought they were (which they are!!) I don’t see the problem? They also said one of the wheels was corroded so required a bead seal. I’m not entirely sure it was but I got charged an extra £24 for the privilege. They also damaged the wheel while putting on one of the new tyres. I think they disturbed an old kerb repair but again their mentality was one of complete denial. I won’t be using this service again. I can see why people just got to main dealers."
Cheaper than anywhere else and you can get them fitted at a reputable garage of your choice
Excellent company to purchse tyres from. I've bought tyres through [REDACTED] for a number of years and find their prices are competitive locally and their partner tyre fitting services I've used are excellent too. I shall continue to buy with BC for as long I need tyres.
"Excellent price and service""Loch Ness Restorations"" were efficient had my tyres fitted in no time"
"I have recommended [REDACTED] to numerous friend. I don’t go anywhere else for tyres. The website is user friendly and allows you to see tyres across the range from budget to high performance. You can pick what tyre you want and see it’s pros and cons as opposed to going to a tyre centre and being given what they have in stock. I have always found the places that I’ve chosen to fit my tyres ([REDACTED] approved) to be polite and expedient when fitting my tyres. I genuinely have no negatives about [REDACTED], and trust me, I’d tell you if I did"
"Always use [REDACTED], easy to use and extremely convenient."
Everything went well no complaints excellent service
Excellent easy to use website with great savings
"Great saving, easy to use, clear communication. Will definitely use again."
replacing tyres in a click you can't complain at that.
Tyre wasn’t delivered in time for fitting. The next fitting appointment was then cancelled. Result of all the delays was my car getting a flat tyre (ironically en route to eventual tyre fitting appointment!) and being stranded at the side of the road with my children and having to pay a different company to rescue me and my tyre. The man at the fitting garage when I managed to get there was then rude and unhelpful.
"Great service and price, would recommend"
Total satisfaction with my transaction
Always a good price for my tyers
"Ordering was easy and transparent. Garage for fitting was the most professional tyre fitter I have used. Staff were friendly, all previous rim damage was noted and signed for before fitting."
except for a late change to appointment time due to an apparent misbooking at ATS
Not the cheapest but required a in common tyre fitted on the drive which happened on time despite receiving an email the afternoon before saying the tyre was not in stock and to re arrange 4/6 days later
We needed a tyre for our Range Rover Evoque quickly as we were about to drive off on holiday and we wanted a tyre that would match the other 3 on the car. We live in rural Scotland so access to services is difficult. [REDACTED] had the tyre we needed at a very reasonable price and offered me 4 sites within a reasonable distance where we could get the tyre fitted within a couple of days. We duly got the tyre fitted very quickly and easily and were delighted with the overall service.
Provides quality tyres at competitive prices
Easy and reliable service.....will use again
Needed to rearrange date/ time twice it was no problem. Very helpful
superb quality easy to order fitted at mconechy's in airdrie staff were great! superb cus
"Great but. All great, except they can‚Äôt be more exact than am or pm for mobile fitting. Would have expected a text the day before giving a narrower window."
Excellent value from a cost perspective and probably the ‘home fitting’ service at a great price I have experienced. Total recommend
There was an issue with the price and although you do not do a price promise Sarah sorted it out for me.
"Good service, quick and efficient, friendly individual."
"Great service. Quick, efficient and professional. These are the go to people if you need tyres. Highly recommended."
My tyres hadn’t been delivered by my appointment time. Wasted an afternoon waiting for them to be delivered.
The cost was lower than the cheapest quote I'd managed to get and the fitting was at one of those that had originally quoted and the service was the same. Very easy to organise and will use again.
"ATS were fine when fitting, although nearly 90 mins for 2 tyres!?The tyres themselves are awful. I've skidded sideways in a car park with them already at only 5mph luckily.... and they seem to have very little grip around corners in damp or worse conditions. The car feels like it'll slide at very low speeds. These were admittedly the budget tyres at 75 pound each, but should be better than this. I'm driving an a6 2 litre tdi by the way...."
Couldn't be simpler
Great prices! Excellent service! One satisfied customer again!!
Good services good people to deal with at the workshop.Will use this service next time I need tryres
Tried to order run flat tyres took 3 calls to the call centre to get a choice then when the garage had fitted the tyres they then found out that the tyres that were delivered were not run flat and had to go through the call centre again to get the tyres re-ordered and re book the fitting. This is the first time in 6/7 years I have had any bother with [REDACTED] but it still was unacceptable and not the service I had expected.
"Not very interested. I have recently had tyres fitted at Tweeddale Motors in Peebles, my second visit through [REDACTED] and they are absolutely fantastic! Friendly efficient and a pleasure to deal with. The reason for the poor rating is this, before my first visit to Tweeddale Motors I had arranged for a fitting in Penicuik. I went to get the tyres fitted and was told that [REDACTED] customers must leave the car for four hours after which the tyres will have been fitted ready for collection. I was unable to do this and said that I would have to return another day. Looking at the [REDACTED] website it stated that a queuing process would be in operation at this location, so I arrived at opening time a couple of days later, only to be told to collect the car in four hours time. Given the absence of customers and the information on the website I explained that I was unhappy with the service being offered and was told that if I did not wish to fit in with their procedure they would return the tyres which I agreed would probably be for the best. I spoke to [REDACTED] about this and, while very sympathetic and offering a discount on the price, they expressed no interest in including the fitting procedures in Penicuik on their website and indeed to this day it appears unchanged. I felt like a second class customer for using [REDACTED] in Penicuik, if the conditions were made plain on the website, I would have been able to make a different choice. Worse was the fact that [REDACTED] customer relations were not interested in addressing what I think is a real issue.Incidentally I did not bother with the discount as I was delighted with the service I received in Peebles."
Ease of ordering and convenience of locality of garages for fitting.
"Always get my tyres from [REDACTED]. Over a few years they have been consistently the best price and great service. My local ATS always does the fitting and they're friendly, efficient and offer good advice."
Simple and easy to arrange on line with good prices. Excellent service at local edwards garage.
Very happy with the service. Highly recommend
Excellent stuff
"[REDACTED] were excellent, however, the fitting company was not very good, slow and got the feeling that as I had not bought the tyres from them, my service was secondary to their other customers."
"Excellent service , lovely staff"
"First time user, but not the last. This is how I’ll buy tyres from now on. Couldn’t have been easier and had a much larger range to choose from. I’m sold"
excellent service would recomend
Very simple and efficient. Good communication. No problems.
"Good price, no hassle at fitters, recommended."
"Very easy to order and fitting station, Alexanders of Twickenham was excellent. In and out in 30 mins. Best way to buy tyres."
Easy to order and book fitting. Good price. Iversons in Chiswick v helpful and efficient.
"Web site was clear and easy to navigate.I chose to have the tyres fitted at home. The fitter was friendly, courteous and efficient.I am very happy with the result."
[REDACTED] are very helpful and I would recommend to anyone
"Ordering and booking time slot on [REDACTED] was easy.I booked my 10AM time slot at ATS.However, when I got to ATS they were busy so was 45mins late. ATS said it was [REDACTED] fault as they just book appointments but don't know how busy the garage is"
Let down so badly - I wish I did not have to give this review even 1 star as they are not worth it.They Emailed me at 17.17 last night saying they could not fit my tires the following day as already arranged. (They close at 17.30). I was traveling 5000 miles round trip the following day and my tires would become illegal during that time so urgently needed them done.They never responded to my email and I was on hold in a phone que for 35 minutes. Got put through to escaltion team who took another 10 minutes to answer.The only thing that was reasonable was the manner in which the complaint team approached the complaint however the best they could do is offer a refund plus £30 and a 10% discount on future purchases. The extra £30 did not even cover the additional costs that I incurred but at least they were polite and sypathetic and agreed to feed back that a phone call so late in the day would have been appropriate to give me some options.. Now trying to find new tyres (not easy in North of Scotland) instead of doing all the other things I had planned for today in prepartion for travelling abroad.Disgusting for such a big company to leave me stranded like this.
"Abs no bs, all gpod in the hood"
First time I've used as recommend by local garage to a new area I've moved into. Firstly the price to order and including fitting was a few pounds cheaper than my previous tyre fitting place I've used before for the same tyre. The booking slots to arrange to have tyre delivered to my choice of garage was an excellent process. I just turned up at my choice of day and time and drove my car in. I had no waiting time unlike when I normally go to a tyre fitting centre.
Easy experience no hassles or hard sell from fitter great service
Half the price of the national chains for the same make and quicker to deliver and install
"Had fitted on the drive great price and service..., the tyre fitter... Dean from dw tyres was great and efficient"
"[REDACTED] were good.The garage I chose messed me about. Purchased on a Wed. Booked a Friday slot for fitting, then got bounced to the following Wednesday. I’ll go with a different fitting garage next time."
Absolutely painless and now I have 4 new Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tyres on my car which are as equally as superb.
"excellent choice and price of tyres, swift appointments at a garage to suite you, no having around. Excellent."
"Simple to use, appointment was as booked and service from ATS was good.Highly recommend this company"
Fast and efficient
"Good experience, tyres arrived and were fitted cheerfully and efficiently."
The 4 Michelin Agilis Campervan tyres for my campervan supplied by [REDACTED] and fitted by my favourite local garage saved me over £65 compared to other local outlets. Excellent all round.
"Simple process, no hiden costs. And great service!"
Very smooth transaction coupled with a very good price. This is the second time I have used them and will certainly use them again.
I’ve had two unfortunate situations where my tyres have gone flat so badly that I couldn’t even take it to the garage! Not only was [REDACTED] able to provide me with new tyres but I love the fact they connect you to garages and mobile garages also! Entire Automotive Ltd - Premier Mobile (London) Helped install my tyre and they did such an amazing job! Thank you
Found it very easy to navigate the Website and to check and compare tyres. The price of the tyres I chose was very competitive and included the fitting etc.From the time I ordered till after the fitting everything went smoothly including choosing the fitting site. No problems with delivery and fitting etc.Would recommend [REDACTED] to anyone looking for new Tyres.
"Our fitter called the evening before he was due to confirm the appointment, he arrived promptly and carried out the work. Once the work was completed, he left everything as expected - clean and tidy.We would use again. :)"
good prices and easy to get tyres fitted at [REDACTED] garage locally .will use and recommend to friends
Excellent both of you extremely happy with the service
"Easy to use website, competitive prices, lots of local fitters."
Great price and hassle free fitting. Easy to arrange and nothing to pay at the fitting centre
Excellent service! Easy to order and pay online. Highly recommend the garage Auto Safety Centre in St Helens.
Really good service. When my tyres were unavailable for the original appointment the team kept me informed of the situation and there was just one day of delay.
"An easy ordering process with the traits of tyres clearly labelled (fuel economy, noise level, water clearance etc).The prices are a lot more competitive than the usual high street places.There are lots of fitting centres are so you can choose a time and place convenient to you."
"Booked in car for tyres, cancelled booking next day. Had to arrange another day! Happy with service eventually. Adrian (Ripon) N.Yorks"
Wrong tyre pressure and deflation warning system not reset
"Excellent service from the minute i arrived. A cup of coffee was offered and gladly taken. Tyres changed without issue, spare relocated in boot and everything back where it should be. The manager was a friendly chap and i will definitely use again."
An efficient company. Tyres reasonably priced. Garage also efficient.
"Brilliant service, brilliant tyres, brilliant prices.Never use anyone else now."
Great value for money quick service 👍
So easy and convenient to use at a time and place of my choice.
"Tyres delivered as promised and in time. Helpful, knowledgeable staff. Fitted locally at a time to suit me. Well done [REDACTED]."
"Easy internet purchase, good quick experience in the dealer"
"Cheap, fast, trustable.... connected me to a really great garage with helpful and nice staff."
"Great service! Easy to use and efficient in execution. Next time I need tyres, Black-circles will be my choice."
"So easy, staff friendly, new tyre put on in minutes."
Ordering was very poor. The website was terrible. Then PayPal wouldn’t work and I had to spend ages on hold. Over an hour in total
"We have used [REDACTED] for years and have never had a problem. Great prices, service and value and the ease of ordering is simple.We always tell friends to go to them as you can book to have tyres done at a local garage from a drop down list."
Cheapest i could find and got them fitted at a garage1 mile from my house. What more could i ask for.
"The process was so simple it was almost unbelievable. I found this website via an online search and was pleasantly surprised. I found tyres I couldn't get from very popular outlets, ordered them straight to the garage and got them fixed all in about 24 hours! The prices were also much better than I got anywhere else after several days of research. I will certainly be using ''[REDACTED]'' again."
Easy to choose tyres and good value for money. Booking system and communication excellent. Service friendly and efficient.
Very good everything was straight forward and was able to get them done in a few days
Good website and purchase experience Good fitting centre- no damage to alloysWould like return customer discounts.
"Excellent service, quick and easy to select tyres and large choice of garages to choose from. Would highly recommend this website, used for my current and previous car with no issues."
Excellent Service - easy to use and available selection of tyres and service centres to fit them.
Very happy with how fast tyres came in to garage. The garage were very good to deal with and did an excellent job of fitting them.
"Quality, trust and value for money"
"No issues whatsoever with [REDACTED]. com. Wide choice of tyres, excellent price. Tyre fitted at chosen garage at time stated."
Like everyone else you shop around to get the best deal. I found [REDACTED] to be the best for me on this occasion with the right tyre fitted at a place and time convenient for me.
"I have used [REDACTED] before and never had any issues, my tyres are available and at a good price, I had no problem with getting a fitting time to suit my schedule."
Easy to use website with good communication once ordered. The garage fitted all 4 tyres at my chosen time and staff polite. Great service
Easy to book the garage at a time to suit you. Lots of suitable tyres and prices to choose from
5 * nice and smooth
"Great. Quick, easy and a really good price."
Great price and great service!
Best price on Internet search for Avon tyres. Mr Tyre on Carlton Road Nottingham fitted the tyres at scheduled time and did a fantastic job. Always used [REDACTED] in the past and found them to be cheapest price for my selected 4x4 tyres.
"all good, a bit disappointed about 10% discount, which was not 10%"
"I was digging around for new tyres and remembered [REDACTED].I plugged in my car details and they were able to provide a great selection of tyres from budget to high end. I selected my tyres and then the local garages they offered was extensive. for a £6 premium I had the tyre fitted at my home.Initially I was told that the appointment I had booked was no longer available which was mildly irritating, on a par with picking up a crisp expecting one flavour and getting entirely another, the lady who mailed me to tell me could not have been nicer and my appointment was changed from AM to PM. No biggie.The Chap who arrived, on time, to replace my tyre called me up form outside, get the necessary from me then called me up 15 minutes later to tell me he was done.Absolutely fantastic service and really pleasant people. I need another 2 tyres soon (no, it's not a Robin Reliant) and will deifinitely be using [REDACTED] again."
The whole process was so easy from picking the best tires for my budget to getting them fitted at a day and time that suited me.I will be back for my next tires.
"Quick and easy purchase process, a little stand offish approach from fitting company."
Cheap and reliable as per usual
Great service. Will be using [REDACTED] again
Exalent service
Very good experience throughout.
Easy to use and is on cashback site. Good price and clear to see different options.
Great....second set of tyres off [REDACTED] in less than a month....great service both Back Circles and the fitting garage. Dont go anywhere else for tyres!
Time change made to appointment twice
Booked in at my local garage (Tudor Garage)Lewis fitted my Hankooks quickly and I was away in just over 40 mins. Two quality front tyres fitted balanced for less than £220- great value!!I have recommended [REDACTED] to all my friends...😬
All stuff r very helpful. They all know Wht they doing and very honest.
[REDACTED] is easy to use and the service was excellent thanks
Easy to use. Lots of choice. Great prices
"I've only given this 5 stars because of the fantastic service Phil provided.I had new tyres fitted a couple of Saturday's ago, four days before my MOT and service.Noticed on the Sunday that the TPMS fault light was on which would be an MOT failure.Went back when they opened on Monday and was told the light was off when the tyres had been fitted. I couldn't take a pressure reading so something was affecting the valve. The valve was fiddled with and I was told to come back the next day when Phil was there.Contacted [REDACTED] CS and was told I'd get a quick callback.However all I got was an email on the Tuesday with all the reasons why a TPMS might fail and to go to the garage.On returning on Tuesday Phil was there, straight away removed the tyre, and it was clear the TPMS must have been damaged during the fitting and then shearing whilst driving at motorway speeds. He couldn't be more apologetic and arranged for their mobile fitter to come out and fit a new sensor.All in all fantastic service and saved the day."
"Tyres were ordered and appointment made with the garage for fitting. Text received to remind us that morning, however by the time we reached the garage the appointment had been cancelled as the wrong tyres had been sent. No text to inform us. [REDACTED] informed us there had been an error and would give us a £20 refund as a good will gesture. We rebooked for later that week but as yet no refund. Very poor experience"
"The company broke my tyre sensor when fitting the tyres, the garage refused to even consider they had caused the damage and did not offer to look at it even though it broke within miles of the tyres being changed. I had to use another garage, and incur an addition fee, to fix the tyres as well as not being able to drive the car. They found the issue quickly and confirmed my tyre sensor had been broken when the tyres were fitted by the previous garage. I would avoid at all cost and look elsewhere, the slightly cheaper tyres is not worth you car being broken and hassle to fix it."
Fantastic service tyres were a great price fitted at my local garage thank you
"Was all good with service an fitting,the garage that fitted them is always great customer service. Will deffo use again."
"Easy to order online no problems fitted as arranged good price, would recommend to anyone."
"The tyres I had ordered were out of stock, however they contacted me and gave me the option of a higher priced set at the same price. The fitting experience was good. Overall a great experience."
Great service! Men were very helpful and polite! Would definitely recommend
"If you are in the market for tyres this is the company to go to. Don't bother trying anyone else, you would not find anyone better. You can also pay using PayPal if you want.Thanks, Kenneth Hallett."
"Cheapest I could find, the service centre was excellent too"
The website is very easy to use. There's a good selection of tyres to choose from and having them fitted.Will use again and again.
Great price and convenient service. Recomended.
Excellent value and lowest price against a number of local suppliers I tried ((National companies)Prompt service and fitting at designated garage. Helped on this occasion by a 10% discount that on four tyres was a good saving.
"Excellent transaction. Very good price for quality tyres, easy site to order and navigate through. Superb fitting carried out by local garage, will certainly use [REDACTED] again and recommend to friends. Bill Smith, Bridgnorth."
Great price great service. And great tyres.
Good smooth service
good price`s on the products and excellent service all round Steve Price managing director of I and S ind doors
Was recommended to [REDACTED] by a friend. Brilliant company. Takes all the hassle out of replacing tyres. Would highly recommend and will be using them again in future
"Ordered two tyres, paid for next day delivery. 5 days later, still no tyres and customer service said that they cannot update me as the delivery driver is not in today. I have not been able to drive my car for 4 days as I have been waiting for my new tyres. Disgusting service and treatment. This is the first and last time that I will be using [REDACTED]. I will be sharing this awful experience on Social Media and with friends, family and colleagues."
"After being let down badly by tyres on the drive, I chose [REDACTED] to provide what I needed in a timely manner to which they did, and credit also to Calum & Ross at A&S Tyres who provided excellent service in the fitting of all four tyres."
Excellent service from you and the garage I will be back for more tyres thank you
"Good price, couldn't source these exact tyres elsewhere. Fitted on time whilst I waited."
Have no problem with what so ever excellent service thank
Top brand tyres at a great priceFantastic service from the fitting centre (McConechys Berwick-upon-Tweed)
"Fast, easy and convenient service."
very good price and speedy convenient fitting of tyres
Good price and easy buying process. Tyre was delivered as per the instructions and fitted on time. Would definitely use again.
Best price possible for tyres. Then give me 10% off on top. Delivered tyres to closest fitters. Job done.
I have used [REDACTED] for many years and have yet to find anyone as cheap as them. Also the booking system is excellent for getting them fitted.
"Easy to use, everything was very simple."
"Tire what I chose OKEY, but little bit old, cose' from 2018... so not happy like previous time.You should tell to custmers around age of tires. I expect tire from 2019."
Great value and no problems ordering or delivery had issue with approved fitting centre but this was promptly rectified and resolved by excellent customer service team at BC
Excellent service and superb tyre fitter
Good price still used the same garage as always. Tyre appears to be good quiet and same braking in the wet as tyres 3 time the price
"Great service, really helpful tyre fitters definitely use again."
Excellent service good product at a very good price
"Great service, no issues, would thoroughly recommend"
"First glass company to deal with, nothing is too much of a problem. I would recommend then without any hesitation.JY"
Good range of tyres at good prices. Arrangements at my local fitter all worked very well.
"the codes dont always work leaving you to contact by phone , and tyre prices are high and the disabled are charged an extra payment if they choose to have tyres fitted at home"
This is the second time I've used [REDACTED] and both with different tyre companies and both times were perfect. I will definitely use again.
Not much cheaper than garages I phoned
"Easy to use, helpful staff."
"First class service, great price, will use again."
"Easy to use website, best prices and friendly, local fitting centre."
"Had tyres fitted at work place during day by mobile fitter. . Excellent fitter great service . Arrived at time arranged and hassle free, worth the extra £6. Would highly recommend."
Good tyres good price
Excellent service from these guys at gils
"Used [REDACTED] three times now and will keep using them.Good price and fitted locally, EXCELLENT COMPANY."
A very 'slick' service!
"Excellent quality, delivery & fitting. Can't fault it!"
Best price I could find and ended up with a premium tyre for the same usual cost of a mid range. The fitting garage were friendly and did an excellent job
Great !The various options you can choose
"Quick, reliable and excellent customer service"
Exactly the tyres I ordered and the gargage did a great job fitting them. Would recommend both :-)
Booked a tyre to be fitted two days later and received confirmation. Next day got an email saying it couldn't be fitted until five days after the day I booked! Went to kwik fit instead and got a tyre fitted next day for same price as [REDACTED] with alot less hassle. Suggest BC show real fitting days instead of fantasy dates that they let people down on
Quick and easy ordering system. Searched the net and tyres were cheapest I could find. Definitely using them again.
So very easy and great prices
"Great service, will use again!"
Very competitive price. But customer service not good. Got an email night before appointment saying sorry but tyres could not be delivered please rearrange. Then a call from garage the following morning asking where I was as tyres were in.
Cheapest tyre quote supplied online and the garage selected in Potters bar was excellent
easy to use and I got discount. Web site gave me info I needed to find my tyre type
I have used [REDACTED] a couple of times and each time it was easy to order and the garage were great. I booked a time slot and was seen on time. I ordered 2 hankook tyres and they were £20 cheaper per tyre than Kwik fit and merit tyres. Will definitely be using them again.
Excellent prices and service as always. will go nowhere else for tyres. 1st class service at approved tyre fitting company based in Beccles Suffolk. Will defo use again
"Always cheapest for quality tyres. This time, a n error on my part required a return and re supply. I spoke to Maureen who delt with the issue and had a new fitting date sorted in minutes. This is my 6th set of tyres from [REDACTED]. I do not bother looking anywhere else."
I always use [REDACTED] as they can get the tyres that I want and not what’s in stock. Highly recommend.
Really easy to choose tyres and book appointment. I arrived quite early and they still took my car in straight away.
Excellent service and good prices highly recommend and will use again
"Not having a the tyres at the last minute, multiple cancelled appointments, an email chain that it seems anyone at [REDACTED] can jump in and out of, but without actually resolving anything. The staff really don’t seem to know what is going on. This all then culminated with the fitter reversing into and damaging our car. It has all gone very quiet since then. I wouldn’t normally leave a review this bad, but I’ve been bombarded with emails asking for my feedback, which they wouldn’t need to solicit if they actually just listened to their customers."
"Large choice of tyres, lots of information, good choice of contractor garages, overall everything went smoothly."
Excellent choice of tyres from an easy to follow website. The choice of fitting date and time from my selected garage went like clockwork - well pleased!
straight forward ordering and tyres now on car - I'm very happy!
Best price good service.
Good choice and very reasonable prices
"Tyres are great and price was great too. However I won't be going back to the garage again. Upon arrival, we walked in reception and weren't greeted. Strange in itself. They then took much longer than I have ever waited for 2 tyres to be fitted, whilst most of the people were standing chatting in the garage, my tyres just sat in the corner for a good portion of the time. There were other cars in, but no other people in the waiting area. I had booked my car in for a tracking assessment online with a view to get the tracking realigned aswell. They then told me after an hour, they had no time to check my tracking, so I went and had this done elsewhere. Very strange experience all over but good product and price"
"Excellent prices, fast service. Will be using [REDACTED] from now on! Thanks!"
"Easy to book, competitive price and good service"
Easy to order the correct tyre. Choose bridgestones for mine. Straight forward and great price.
"Looking for good quality branded matching tyres to those already fitted to the car, easy to find and order on the website. Many more choices available if looking to for something different. Booking the local garage was also easy with new tyres delivered directly to them for fitting at the pre-arranged appointment. Overall a good experience."
Really easy website to navigate with clear prices for the various tyre options including ratings.
Good customer service. I was informed about minor d√©tails that I was not aware of.
"I was able to browse tyres & prices without sales pressure then chose convenient garage, turn up,go & have tea & a roll whilst it was all done, couldn't fault service."
"Brilliant service, very competitive pricing and clear and timely communication. Highly recommended!"
"Easy to use website with multiple choices of tyres ranging from budget to premium and a good selection of [REDACTED] tyres. No fuss at tyre fitting centre, easy and quick."
"Excellent service with good choice of tyres. The garage used, Wheel in Tyres (Whitstable) was first class would recommend."
Excellent friendly service with impressive facilities
Great service and links to brilliant independent garages such as Ashwell Motors in Liverpool. Revolutionised how anyone should buy tyres!
Great TyresBest PricesSuperb ServiceHave already got my family buying from youFitted at my local garage Will 100% be coming to you for my next tyre changeGood Work
excellent service as usual
First class service tyres were good value and exactly what was ordered and garage used was efficient and friendly would definitely use [REDACTED] again
"I booked on line at £62 for the tyre fitted, on the payment page was given a £10 discount 😊 booked my slot for 7.15, I got there at about 7.10 and by 7.30 I was on my way, the guys were polite and professional. Highly recommend."
East trouble free experience
Quality tyres reasonably priced. Local garage fitted with good service
Good saving and good service.
Great price...would have been five star only it took two weeks forctyres to show up!
No issues at all. Easy and convenient service
Speedy service
Excellent hassle free service and competitively priced
"Good honest service, kept you informed from purchase, fitting,"
Brilliant tyres. Amazing value and great service
Simple and quick
fair price good information on tyres and ease of booking
Really easy to use... will be back for more when required... can’t say fairer than that!!
Absolutely simple and stress free experience. Reasonably priced tyres with plenty of information available on the site and an easy to understand grading system. Able to select a garage right on my doorstep and the fitting was done at a time convenient to me. Cant ask for anymore.
Brilliant website good deal's & really recommend fast delivery a***
Took longer than expected as there was no one else in. But good job done.
"I have used [REDACTED] twice, having previously used other on line retailers. I prefer [REDACTED] as there is a good range of tyres available at good prices, and a local fitting agent."
"Great tyre, good price, just a little concerned at the recommended fitting centre. Although these type of centres tend to be very male dominated and slightly intimidating, particularly for females, this one was an extreme example of it’s type. This is not the first time we have had unnerving experiences at tyre fitting centres, but we both felt that online tyre retailers need to have more strict vetting of their recommended fitting partners, to raise the bar to the standards they would wish to experience themselves."
"Best price, good service, what more could you want?"
FABULOUS PRICESSUPER QUICK DELIVERYQUALITY PRODUCTSVERY VERY VERY PLEASED! Will never buy tires from the likes of ATS EVER AGAIN!!!!
"Reasonable prices, useful information on the web site (could do with more info on the rim protection offered by each Tyre?), carefully fitted (by ATS Aldershot), will use again, recommend to anyone."
"Excellent service, cheap and good quality."
Easy to book fitting online. Great price and great service.
Seamless and excellent experience. Would recommend without hesitation.
"Good price, easy purchase and excellent fitting service from Mcconnachie tyres, Forfar."
Completely hassle free experience from first contact with yourselves and until I collected my car with the new tyres fitted. I will certainly be using this service again and will not hesitate to recommend to others.
"This was s a 1st time tyre purchase, buying direct, also having them fitted on the drive, the process was seamless from start to finish."
Good company with excellent customer service.
Brilliant service ordered tyres two days later they were fitted at garage i chose. Cannot fault it and best price for tyres.
very freindly people tyres fitted at the slotted time when booked.
Tires were perfect and service was great. Would definitely use again in near future 👍🏻
EXCELLENT AND QUICK SERVICE
very quick service
Easy service
"very straightforward and simple service, no waiting around and procedere did not take long. It was easily booked online"
"Simple, no stress and convenient. What an excellent way to do business."
Only thing stopping one star is that my refund was very quick.
"Great prices, and very good 'premier partner' for fitting. They were easy to get to, and did a really quick job replacing my tyres. The [REDACTED] website is pretty easy to navigate and gives many options when selecting tyres. My only critical feedback is that the website could be more helpful in explaining the rated tyre performance, in particular the meaning and impact of the different rolling resistance ratings.I will continue to use [REDACTED] in the future."
Product details were great. Had choice of garage to put truck to. In problems with fitting if tyres.
"Tyres at a good price, fitted locally. Easy to use"
Great value for money and delivered when advised.
Quick easy and excellent service. Would highly recommend [REDACTED]
No problems got the tyres at a lower price garage excellent
Would've been 5 stars had there not been in a 2 day delay. Will definitely recommend.
"I've bought several motorcycle tyres from [REDACTED] and always thought the service and value were good.However the front of the pair of motorcycle tyre I bought on the last occasion was defective. The tyres were fitted and balanced by my very experienced tyre man but I discovered that at speeds over 45mph the handlebars oscillated and this worsened until by 60mph it was unbearable. Tyre man removed, refitted and rebalanced the tyre but problem remained. Tyre man spotted that the tyre did not run true, the carcass was distorted. Tyre man fitted an old tyre and all was well, thus proving the new tyre was faulty. This was reported to [REDACTED] and they replaced the tyre and took the defective tyre for analysis. This at no cost to myself.That is brilliant and gives me great confidence to continue using [REDACTED]. First class customer service! Thank you [REDACTED]."
Very friendly and helpful staff
It's not the first time I have used these guys and again fantastic.I drive a big Lexus LS and to have all five tyres changed for £411.00 is a great price.The tyres I chose have better braking distance than some of the so called better names at half the price.So I am very happy.Thsnk you [REDACTED].
"offered me dates and a garage which i accepted. then they changed the dates and garage!when i eventually arrived at the garage for fitting, the garage wasnt sure if the tyres had been delivered which led to a further wait. The garage did a good job but constantly moaned about [REDACTED].com and i had to agree with them, as [REDACTED] were pretty much crap and it would have been so much easier to just book direct with the garage. [REDACTED] said i didnt give then enough notice to arrange fitting at my chosen garage. i gave them 4 days! had i gone direct to the garage i only had to give a days notice. [REDACTED], you were rubbish!"
"A great choice of tyres at competitive prices. Booking and fitting is a doddle, overall I would not go anywhere else."
Easy to use website; wide choice of tyres at great prices including delivery and fitting.
I went to a local tyre garage and didn't know what type of of tyre I would be buying within my price range. With [REDACTED] you can choose which tyres are available and what the tyre provides for your needs. I will definately use yourselves again. Thank you
Good fast service. good tyres for the price!!!
Website easy to use. Nominated garage near & very good
"I have used [REDACTED] for years and would recommend it. You could probably save a few pounds if you hunted around and went out of your way - but for a simple, reliable service at a competitive price and with a wide choice, they can't be beaten. Makes a drudge task very straightforward."
Good prices. Great selections. Lots of fitting places to chose. But make sure you know the fitting place before booking as some offer bad/poor services. Time to delivery the tyre or fitting could be improved. Waiting 2 days for the tyre/fitting.
"Quick, easy to use, great service, the garage I was sent to was fantastic. Will definitely recommend"
"Easy to complete, garage selection was good, job done!"
Very easy to order and a fair price.second time of using [REDACTED] and will use again.
"Organised, professional, easy."
"I’ve used [REDACTED] a few times in the past and found the whole process to be simple, convenient and quick. I really can’t fault the company or the service. Communication regarding my order was excellent and I will definitely use [REDACTED] again!"
"Got 4 tyres to fit at Apha Automobiles a premium garage they said 🤔but got all 4 Alloy wheels damaged and not enough evidence they said 🤔sent photos of the weels but as the garage have the latest fitting equipment they said it was made by me instead 😕 what???? Now I have to refurbish them from my own pocket, worst customer service ever😤"
"Firstly I had no email to tell me when my tyres were dispatched. They didn't appear on the date specified, I called support staff a total of 5 times to chase up because I was promised call backs (twice), they didn't happen. It's not fair to treat customers that way, we need to be reassured you're on the case then we'll confidently buy from you again."
"I ordered two tyres initially on Bank Holiday Monday then the following day it was decided another two would be a good idea.Overnight the price increased by £4 a tyre, not a lot but not appreciated!The fitters, in the village where I live, as usual were very good."
"[REDACTED] offered a great price for the product I wanted, unfortunately I was let down by the garage I picked to fit the tyres. I will use [REDACTED] again but not that garage in Swardeston"
"No fuss, easy purchase. Delivered to my chosen garage without any issues."
What you want when ordering tyres over the Internet is a reliable trustworthy service that gets the tyres you ordered to the garage you want to fit them in time and without any issues.......[REDACTED].......never fail.......I’ve used them in the past......and will continue to use them in the future.5 stars from me
Great price and local choice of locations to fit tyres.
"From my experience with [REDACTED].com over recent years, I highly recommend their service! Good products, prices & follow up, to ensure work is carried out atyour chosen Tyre Fitters, is second to none!"
"Great prices, excellent range and conveniently located partners for fittting"
"Yet again,a first rate service provided by [REDACTED] and the associated fitter, who did so at the appointed time in a very professional manner. Cannot complain!"
"Quick and easy.Highly recommended.Bought tyres on [REDACTED] as my local garage could not get a better deal on my preferred tyre options that day.The tyres arrived ahead of time / 1 day early and M C Motors were pro active in getting me on to their site to change the tyres as soon as possible, as well as completing the MOT same afternoon.Wonderful service levels from both companies!"
Worked a treat.
"There was a delay in delivery to the fitters which was notified in advance and luckily not a problem.My slight annoyance is that normally I would expect to receive the same batch of tyres for each axle, however the age marking on the rear axle shows one was fairly new and the other around 18 months old."
Fast and friendly service. Called when car was ready. Only issue was pressures were way out.
Really good price for tyres. Good fitting service.
"Easy to follow web site, good selection of tyres in stock, reasonable prices,good explanation of tyre spec.a few chioces of local fitting garages. Well organised, garage, had the booking and the correct tyres. They, were fitted on time, within 30 mins. great job done."
"Excellent service, easy to use website and I was able to get my tyres fitted at a garage near to where I was, whilst away with work."
Always efficient...great prices
Simple enough to get a new tyre and have it fitted at a local centre. took about 5 minutes on-line and about 15 minutes at the garage.
Best price for the tyres i needed. Easy to order and arrange local fitting.
Fast efficient informative recommended
"Excellent service would recommend to everyone , very easy to order and select local garage to fit tyres ."
Easy webpage to use. Garage was good
Everything went very smoothly. Tyres were fitted very professionally albeit on the slow side. Prices were very competitive and I would certainly use again. Well done.
"I have used this company several times mainly because if their competitive prices, however once I have ordered my tyres and paid for them and booked my fitting time I believe that all is good , however as has happened today for my fitting tomorrow I have just had a cancellation email as the tyres haven’t been sent to the garage.This seems to be a common problem going by other reviews so my question is how can they be so incompetent, it should be simple , customer orders tyres, they should be delivered to relevant garage to be fitted...simple. But once again they have failed me ( I don’t think I will use them again and would not recommend them) other issues I’ve previously had were booked into a garage for a Saturday appointment when the garage didn’t open on a Saturday and another appointment was cancelled because they didn’t have enough fitters!"
Garages who fit the tyres don't know what there doing.
"I have used [REDACTED] for years, buying puncture replacements, replacing worn out tyres and getting Snow Tyres for mountain driving. If you need help, the staff are great. Really good company that seems to have a good reputation with my local ATS garage of choice. Latest purchase was a cheap as possible [REDACTED] Value Choice 175/65 R14 H for my son's 15 year old C2. As usual, prompt fitting and good tyre - for just £38. I continue to be impressed with this company - they were recommended to me a while back by a friend, and I've recommended them to others many times since"
First class service. Great tyre choices and deals which are delivered on time and to the high standard expected. I've used them before and will use them again.
"First class all round experience from ordering to fitting at ATS shrewsbury. Takes all the hassle out of buying the tyres you require at a good price. For me, the only way to buy tyres."
Good selection of tyresEasy to navigate websiteCompetitive prices
"The website is very easy to use and gives a great selection of brands, prices and explanations of tyre types."
"Superb service - clear and easy to use website, quick and easy to buy, very competitive prices, good communication and a great service from their approved fitters - Longbridge Tyres. This is my second purchase and I wouldn't go anywhere else now. I have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone."
Friendly people job done well 👍
Fast and reliable service as always
"Quick and easy service, would definitely recommend it."
"Tyres okay, good price, service at one of their approved centres below average, since have to pump up tyres to correct pressure after visit."
Excellent service and quality tyres. I don’t need to look anywhere else.
"Great principle, paid for my tyre, great price, chose my local ATS garage job done. The garage however needs a bit of a tidy up, it was cold in the waiting area and the hot drinks machine was broken I had to wait for the tyre to be fitted and would have liked a hot drink. It was winter and horrible weather."
"Very easy to use!I especially liked that I could book a timeslot to have the tyres changed at the time of purchase. Just turned up at the workshop, no further calls were necessary. Left with new tyres installed, no hassle at all."
"Polite, good job, highly recommend"
Great service great price and a good quality tyre.
Excellent communication with the the [REDACTED] team in making a late booking for the weekend. They found me Target Tyres and Exhausts in Northolt and they were great too. Thanks.
Great Service Easy to use Huge savings Highly recommended
wheels fitted on time and as described
Was good experience
Easy to use web site pick a close by garage with great staff plus the best price around will always use [REDACTED]
"Overall, I received a good, no frills service by having the worn front tyres replaced on my Toyota. Unfortunately, they weren't able to go the 'extra mile' for me when I asked the receptionist at the time whether the partially worn rears, could be swapped with the new fronts. This was not granted as there wasn't a four poster ramp available. Not so sure I'll go back there as previous garages I've used, have always undertaken this cost saving work for me."
"Absolutely fantastic service. All done as planned.No problems, had all 4 tyres done outside my own home.Well happy with the result."
Very quick service tyres ready to fit at chosen place which were very friendly
"Very competitive tyre prices coupled with a really helpful fitting service (thanks Best Autocentre, Newport, Isle of Wight) means that I would recommend [REDACTED]."
Great service and exceptional price once again from [REDACTED].
"Quick, reliable and cheap. Thanks"
Good price and service.
Good all around experience. I would recommend it to a friend
Great price and fitted at the time agreed
Excellent service can’t recommend enough gud job
"[REDACTED] do a great job at getting the tyres at a great price, but they crash and burn when it comes to getting them nice tyres fitted.So if you have time to sit watching some cowboys trying to fit your tyres, go for it.I'll pay a bit more next time and have them fitted before the sun goes down, and the coffee was crap as well :)"
Did what it said on the site no problems at all
"Good service, liked being able to pick the tyres and time at my leisure. Price was good."
Easy to order and great price.
"booked very quickly, found out the local ATS would be fitting them, (0.2 miles from me) tryes were fitted in an hour for all 4, what more could you want?"
"Good value, great service."
good price good service from garage
Fantastic quick and helpful service
"WALTON GARAGE VERY VERY HELPFUL, WENT ON A DAY EARLY MY MISTAKE, MANAGED TO FIT ME IN,THE SERVICE AND HOSPITALLITY WAS EXCEPTIONAL. All I have to do is return to have torque settings on bolts!!!"
"Just brilliant.£60 cheaper for two front tyres, brand used was like for like.The ease of booking everything on line , fitting at a local tyre garage...will most definitely use again"
Good choice of suitable tyres. Easy ordering process. Great to find a VERY local garage to fit tyres at a convenient time. Will happily use again.
Very easy to deal with. I have used them a few times and always found them very helpful
"My second time to buy tyres from [REDACTED] ,always the best and cheapest and very efficient. I will recommend them to all my friends and family. Thank you. Kind Regards Allan"
"Great price and service all round, can't fault them :)"
Hassle free went to outlet to get tyres fitted and that's what happened without the garage trying to sell me a new car or parts to build a new car as one tends to get with some other tyre fitters.
Great price and choice. I used a mobile fitter arranged through the site and he came a day earlier than booked having called in advance
It’s just price and convenience. As long as you choose good fitters.
Very easy quick way to order tyres at a good price. Service at garage was great. On time and very pleased from start to finish. Would use again and recommend.
Excellent customer service as I needed to change my appointment time. [REDACTED] made the change and called back promptly 👍👍Competitive price too. Would have been 5 stars but on arrival at the fitter I was initially told there was an hours wait before the car could be looked at 😡 However they managed to fit me in!
Quick amd easy and good value for money
Quick friendly good service
Got four tyres at a reasonable price for my Mercedes GLE They were fitted by local Fairfield garage in Stockton all done very professionally Only reason for not giving 5stars not down to garage but [REDACTED] as they send you a 10% off after you spend £700
As ever a friendly welcome and efficient service.
Buying tyres was just so easy and I could be confident they were the right ones. A stress free process. The garage was also fantastic with a friendly and fast service.
[REDACTED] was excellent. Easy to order the tyres online and great to be able to choose the date and time. The work was done efficiently and we are 100% happy!
"Short wait but worked well. (Finchley Roadrunners via online [REDACTED].) Will likely use again for my next pair of tyres.There is some attempt to get you to up the job with extras when you are first booking online, but thankfully not when you get to Roadrunners."
Excellent service again. Thank you.
"Have been buying my tyres from [REDACTED] now for several years and always feel I have had a good deal with regards to price. It is so easy to place orders with them online, very hassle-free and I like the way they arrange fitting locally keeping me updated with reminders."
"Easy to book, good price and quick fitting - about an hour for 4 tyres."
Made it very simple to sort out and with a great price and good service at ats with the fitting. So very happy.
Very friendly staff members. Done a good job within the time I was told.
Great Prices Great Local Service
"The garage that [REDACTED] suggest was absolutely terrible.Very bad service took forever just to fit two tyres, tried to belittle me about to tyres I brought and the size.Then binned my authentic bwm caps and put some cheap ill fitting caps on and got Funny with me when I wanted them back!Thanks [REDACTED] for putting me through this terrible service.I suggest actually looking into the garage before signing them up"
No problems other than a slow response to a request for an appointment change
Excellent - A very good selection of services to choose from at [REDACTED].
Awful experience chose this provider as believed it was a fast and easy choice however I found myself without a car for over 1 week with 3 separate appointments made for tyre installation as they kept having “issues” with with delivering them on time customer service was poor and an all over disappointing service
Great service from [REDACTED] and very good fitting service very pleased with my four Michelin crossclimate tyres.Good price and all done professionally.
"Needed a tyre fitted in my drive, after a sidewall ripped half a mile from my house.[REDACTED] are my go to website and they offer mobile fitted, so a no brainer."
"If you are like me and work miles from my home, don't have time to call round all the local tyre centres when you need tyres, then what more is to say.I definitely recommend this company as the way forward, the website is easy to navigate, prices are best by far, I was kept well informed of the progress of the delivery.What made the most difference was the fact that they were not only cheaper than anywhere else, but I could get on with my working day.The guys that came out to fit the new tyres at my place of work arrived on time, were very professional and did a great job without me having to sit about in a reception area."
"What’s to say ,excellent service,best price that I could find easy way to get tyres."
Saved £110 against the normal high street prices. Recommended
Process from start to finish was spot on just like previous orders. Reasonably priced tyres delivered as requested on time and fitted by a trusted partner to a high standard. Absolutely no complaints and will definitely use [REDACTED].com again. Cheers.
Good price. Good enough tyre. Fitted locally in a few days. All good. No worries.
"Great, so easy and good value, would use again and recommend to my friends and family."
It’s my first time to use this company. All went very smoothly from start to finish. And got a 10% discount 👍🏼 Very happy
"My local garage that services my car pointed out both my front tyres had worn badly on the inside edge's. They mentioned they were approved [REDACTED] tyre fitters. [REDACTED] had special offer on the new all weather Michelin tyres, so no brained. All went swimminglyy. Ordered, delivered and fitted."
"Very easy to use, cheaper than direct with garage, keep you informed when garage make errors /double book etc"
Excellent price service. Recently bought 2 new tires from [REDACTED].com & was very pleased with the price which was much cheaper than I could find any where else. Gave several places for the fitting service near me which was done as soon as we arrived & back on the road within 25 minutes. Only issue we had was that the tire pressure warning light was on after fitting. They said it will go out when I start driving but it did not. Stopped at a petrol station & found the new tires were well below the correct pressure. Perhaps if they are not sure of the pressure then they should ask the customer. Not a big issue & easily resolved. Highly recommend & wont hesitate to look there when I need anymore tires.
Very friendly and reliable service 😊
"Have bought from [REDACTED] a few times now. Great prices, good service, very happy to recommend"
Great service at good value prices
Good choice and prices. Great communication.
"Good service , good price , tyres fitted at the allotted garage on time would recommend [REDACTED]."
Efficient & friendly service. Would highly recommend
Always great. Simple website. Good prices. Easy to arrange tyre change. Always use.
[REDACTED] themselves are really good and reliable but I would suggest they need to review some of the garages that they use for the fitting. I arrived early at the garage I used and waited 2 hours to have 4 tyres fitted. When asked if they had done the free tracking they said they knew nothing about it and that [REDACTED] tells them nothing. I felt like the garage begrudged fitting the tyres. I would use [REDACTED] again but would never go back to that garage again.
"Very wide range of tyres. Always seem to have in stock the particular ones I'm seeking. Their ""premier garage"" I use for fitting always takes special care of my sports car."
Home fitting Brilliant brilliant
"i purchased some Michelin cross climate + great price cheaper than any body else, so i will us them again. great service."
Everything went to plan.
"Found the service extremely fast and efficient, also very reasonably priced."
"Have used this company before with no real problems. This time....terrible. First visit to fitter, incomplete order....second visit, wrong tyres sent! So much wasted time....and don't even start me on their telephone system. Don't bank on speaking with someone any time soon. You might like listening to repetitive music and the same recorded message, but for almost an hour??!! There are other, equally competitively priced competitors out there, I would try them!"
Yet again great tyres at a great. Price fitted locally
"I can’t fault the experience of ordering new tyres with [REDACTED], there’s usually a choice of tyres from budget to well known manufacturers. Enter your car reg and it will suggest the most likely sizes you need."
very efficient service from dedicated garage would use again
Brilliant! I wish I had found them earlier!!
Excellent price for great quality tyres. Easy to use website. Highly recommend.
"Easy to use website, great prices, convenient appointment time at the garage - well done [REDACTED].Let down by the local garage which took 1 hour to fit 2 tyres, but is that [REDACTED] fault? No.Overall, very impressed and will use again (but via a different garage next time!)."
Good price and ats good fitters
"Simple straightforward transaction with [REDACTED], best price on the tyres i wanted as well, id use them again. Tyrespot on the other hand ill be staying clear in future, my cars still on axle stands with a damaged wheel and tyre valve."
Fabulous service.....easy process online ordering with comprehensive choice of fitting venues. Very competetive prices. Thoroughly recommend [REDACTED].
Price and ease of ordering good. Tyres weren’t delivered on time and notice of late delivery was misleading ie suggested tyres may be at garage when in fact the garage had told [REDACTED] that they hadn’t been delivered.
Great choice of tyres and prices with easy ordering. Tyre fitting service went like clockwork.
"Excellent service. I needed to replace one tyre urgently because of slight damage, which meant I was not completely happy driving a distance on the one I had. I needed an absolute match to my other tyres and quick service. I got both with [REDACTED], at the best price I could see and fitting within 2 miles do home within 48 hours.Thank You !"
Great range allowed me to select the tyres I wanted. Good prices and easy to book fitting at a specialist near me at a time that suited.
Good experience with buying and receiving my product. Very pleased with the service.
"Good prices and easily arranged fitting, do you need anymore?"
An excellent service and experience. So easy to use and straight forward. I can’t rate it highly enough!! ⭐️
"Tyres ordered, appointment booked at local garage. Tyres fitted, wheels balanced - all first class"
"Good service indeed. Previously tried to source what I wanted elsewhere with no success. [REDACTED] had them, made a convenient local appointment for fitting and delivered on time."
really good experience
"I took my car in for 2 new tyres. I turned up at nearly lunchtime, they were really busy. I gave them my keys, they said it'd be awhile as it#s first come, first serve and would most likely be about 2-3 hours. I went away and the car was ready in half the time. Really pleased with the work they did!"
Very easy to use.The search function using your cars registration number is very helpful.I was able to find the exact tyres I was looking for at a good price..The local ATS centre that fitted the tyres was very efficient and professional..I will definitely use this service again.
"Plenty of choice, good prices, lots of local tyre fitting places to choose from."
Brilliant idea and it really works
Easy way to buy tyres. You can choose your new tyres pay for them and book an appointment for fitting at a choice of garages. I found the whole process simple and positive experience. I would recommend [REDACTED].com as an excellent way to buy tyres.
Just as you would expect - tyres delivered to fitter and good job done there.
Excellent service. The garage called up to check the tyres were correct for my car. Everything was ready for the fitting. It was done very quickly. Cheapest set of Michelin tyres I've ever had for this car!
"Good price....however....strongly recommend phoning your garage to confirm the order is booked and tyres have been delivered before you drop car off. First time I arrived on date and time and the garage had told [REDACTED] it was fully booked and couldn't fulfil request. Nobody told me. I re booked with [REDACTED], had e mail confirmation and turned up and the garage hadn't received the tyres. Finally got tyres fitted at 3rd time of asking!"
The whole service from start to finish was easy and efficient
Good value quick appointment. All good.
Fantastic service quick and simple will definitely use [REDACTED] again
"Best price for the tyres I needed, and conveniently fitted at a garage near me."
I would recommend using [REDACTED] to purchase tyres for the following reasons:- Website easy to usea good range of tyre choicesa good range of fitting centres locally and booked appointments
"Fab from start to finish great price, good quality, if using mobile fitters it's a time n place that suits you. Couldn't ask for better"
Brilliant service very easy to book on line
Value for money and hassle free
Dealing with [REDACTED] was fine the local fitters were not as help full as they might have been I gave them in 2 wheels with tyres that were done and they fitted the tyres fine I asked if they would put them on the front of the car and was informed they were to busy to do so.
"Straight forward ordering process, arrived on time at chosen fitter and fitted without drama by a very pleasant chap (ATS Swindon, Holby drive). They were £30 a pair cheaper for specific Branded tyres (Michelin Agilis GreenX) than my usual home-fitting tyre supplier. I Will definitely be using [REDACTED] again :-)"
"I’ve tried competitors in the past and decided to give [REDACTED] a go via eBay. I was a little anxious (being as via eBay in general) but was incredibly pleased with the process, the price, and the service at my local garage. 10/10"
Everything happened as it should. The guys at Jeffreys High Performance Tyres were really helpful and kept me updated during fitting. Will be buying my tyres this way from now on!
[REDACTED] offers top brand tyres at very competitive prices. The local fitting option makes the process very convenient.
"Very good performance, value for money, would definitely buy again and great customer service."
good value for money and the fitting garage were very good and helpful
"[REDACTED] online experience excellent. I would recommend some grading perhaps associated to notifying customers how busy their chosen garage is at booking slots.I had to wait a couple hours, gave up and returned a different day. No fault of garage either"
"Price, convenience and able to select when and where you have your tyres fitted."
"The choice of tyres second to none, website easy to navigate / place order for tyres. The partnership with local firm Martin Brothers Jarrow , customer service was brilliant and so efficient."
"Everything went smoothly, Lloyds BMW even fitting the tyres for me after I was late for the appointment."
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍10
"Excellent service easy to order, good choice of installation dates with local garage"
Such an easy process and delivered to approved garage of choice.
"Very good service. I have been using this company for a few years now, and have always found them very helpfull and pleasant. very easy to work with. I would highly recommend them."
Used before. Will use again. Best prices. What’s not to like?
Very easy to book. Competitive prices. Local fitting centre.
"Lovely man, very friendly"
"Buying tyres from [REDACTED] was very easy. I viewed all the the makes of tyres available, which was a lot. I chose the tyres with the best ratings for economy, grip and low noise, which were Dunlop in my case. I received my appointment time at the garage I have always used for tyres. When I kept the appointment the 4 new tyres were waiting for me to have them fitted. A couple of mechanics set to work and all 4 tyres were fitted very quickly and the car was back on the road. No problems and I will use [REDACTED] again."
Very good quality service
Very good price. Easy to arrange appointment at a convenient time with a local supplier.
"Good price and choice, arrived on time and professional service"
"Apart from a rescheduled fitting date, ordering tyres from [REDACTED].com was quick and easy. Service at Philip White Tyres, Belfast was excellent."
Very good service definitely recommended
Very easy service good garage and service .first time using [REDACTED] and very happy with ease and professionalism of the company .Thank You.
Great fast professional experience.
Cost effective and reliable.
Nice and easy to order and get fitted when i wanted
excellent service. would recommend.
The small garage used to fit the tyres was excellent. Thank you.
Second purchase. Says everything. The specific tyre I wanted at the right price fitted locally when I wanted it.
"Excellent service, Tyre Right at Berkeley could not have been mire helpful"
Quick access to a vast range of quality tyres and independent garages at remarkable prices. As long as you can plan a few days ahead you’ll reap the rewards.
The guys in the garage were very polite and efficient
Helpful website for correct/best tyre choice.Then offered choice of garages in my area and then book appointment. Email confirmation and tyres fitted within 20-30 minutes of arrival.
"On time, good service"
Decent tires and very cheap
"Very easy to use the website, and ‘[REDACTED] arranged everything with the garage. Very straightforward. Prices better than garage quotes. Overall delighted."
"It’s a win, win for everyone. [REDACTED] makes money, the tyre fitter makes money, and more importantly the customer saves money"
Back to the usual quality service
"Wholeheartedly recommended this service, although the price to replace the same tyre brand (Michelin) was about £10 more expensive than previously purchased was a shame."
"[REDACTED].com is good, can always get a fair price, only the Protyre Enfield is rubbish, the garage is like a cowboy garage, people in Enfield beware of Protyr Enfield. this company BAD BAD BAD"
Excellent price and choice. Can’t fault [REDACTED] or my local ATS in Saffron Walden
"New tyres - quick, efficient and friendly"
Good price for the tyres and happy with the service
Great vale for money combined with a first rate insraller
"The process was quick and easy, the tyre price was very good, I turned up at the appointed time at my local ATS and was home again within the hour."
Very good only thing not happy about was I was booked in but yet they had 2 cars in front of me so had a long wait. Can't understand. What the point is in making an appointment for a set time
Great company and easy to use website. Just type in your registration and all the available tyres are listed with prices and easy to read features such as noise rating etc. Choose your garage and the tyres are waiting for you!I’ve used this company loads of times and have never been let down.I highly recommended them.
Perfect from start until finish
Web site easy to use lots of choice -good prices - easy access to fitting agents - confirmed booking - and the fitting went as informed and planned
"Prices are very competitive, and our local [REDACTED] approved garage offers exceptional service.Recently I ordered the wrong size tyres and [REDACTED] customer services were brilliant at correcting my mistake. I thoroughly recommend them."
"Have been using [REDACTED] for many years and highly recommend them. Great choice, prices and services every time. Puts you in control of the tyre buying process rather than being at the mercy of what the tyre fitter has in stock and wants to sell on the day"
Excellent service from [REDACTED].com. Best price for my BMW Michelin Sport 4 tyre. But best bit was the garage used that was only round the corner from me. It managed to take old tyre off and replace new one with absolutely no damage - Well chuffed and would recommend this garage highly as well as BC.
"This is the second time that I have purchased Tyers from [REDACTED] and find them very competitive on price, plus they give me confidence in the quality of the Tyers fitted. I can‚Äôt fault the tyre company that fitted them ATS Shrewsbury."
The garage I selected to fit the tyres were not able to fit them on the day I booked. [REDACTED] found me an alternative. So kudos to them. Their own brand tyres look good and handle well too.
Service from [REDACTED] was a 10 but the authorised garage really let the experience down.
"The tyres I wanted, at the cheapest price, fitted when I wanted - what’s not to like"
"No refund. Cancelled order with full refund. 6 weeks later, checked bank balance - no refund at all!"
"Great service great price , everything they said it would be"
"One problem was with the order being not completed as it should have been, and resulted in one appointment being cancelled and the other not being placed correctly with the fitting station, not good on this occasion."
Tyres were priced competitive and had them fitted within in two day of purchase well pleased
"Great service, simple and good price."
It was Simples!
Postponed my appointment which was inconvenient.
"Good price on the tyres we wanted and were able to have them fitted at the garage we usually use. Delivered direct to the garage and fitted at a specific time, you can’t get much easier."
"I purchased 2 tyres from [REDACTED] to have them fitted at home (an extra £6 charge). My partner was home on the day of fitting.Upon my inspection both replacement tyres are missing their dustcaps and the front tyre had rubber hanging over the valve... I don't even know how to describe it, it's almost like a glove albeit with a big tear down it.I sent an email and photos to [REDACTED] yesterday which has gone unanswered, and tried to call them today. Despite it still being their office hours. they're already playing the ""our offices are closed, call back on Monday"" message... This is my first time using them. I'll go back to asdatyres in future"
Excellent - recommend
"Back for another set of front tyres for my SLK 55. Always get a good price and the service is excellent. Friendly, courteous staff take care of changing the tyres whilst I go for a quick coffee. Recommended."
Few dealers had tyre of this size and type to match other tyres on car. Also offered best price
"Great service, lots of choices for different price range and garages in my area"
"Fitted two 245/45/R19 XL Avon ZX7 to the front of my T5 at F&M auto care Willand very friendly professional bunch. We have been touring Wales in the camper no immediate issues,the Avon’s are quieter and the grip is there in the wet good all round choice will replace the back when worn with the same tyre"
Excellent service - local and efficient. Friendly tyre fitter and two tyres fitted within the hour. Great - I'll be booking this again.
Choice of brands & price very simple to choose.No hassle getting tyres fitted .Highly recommended.
"Excellent Service, Website easy and informative, advises on choice and helps select best garage for fitment, would not use anywhere else,"
"Returning customer, this time with Warrington Truck and Van, Westbrook!!Excellent service, speedy and professional!!"
I’ve used [REDACTED] a few times now and they’ve always given great service. I’ve ordered tyres to be fitted and mail order. Always recommend them to anyone looking for tyres.
Quick and convenient online service with good local choices of garages to choose from with a time that suits you to get the tyres fitted. I have used them about 3 times over recent years and would definitely recommend them.
"Easy to choose and order tyres, can book 1 hour slot with my choice of tyre fitting company. Excellent."
Everything was A number 1. thanks
"simple to use, after ordering tyres i was given a coice of garages, i picked the closest and was messaged an appointment within 3 days, work was done while i waited so very happy with the smoothness of it from start to finish, my thaks to all concerend"
"Would recommend. However, I would say the [REDACTED] website isn't the easiest to navigate. Perhaps only because I was unfamiliar with it!"
Very pleased with service and I would recommend.
"Everything was very easy,from the ordering on line to turning up for the appointment to have the tyre's fitted."
"Absolutely excellent service, from the total price, to the communication of the mobile unit coming to my home and doing a great job, awesome all round service, thankyou."
"The whole process went like clockwork. The only slight concern I have, is that prior to the new tyres having been fitted, there were no problems with my steering wheel. Having had the new tyres, when I reached 70mph on the motorway, I had steering wheel vibration. I assumed that there needed to be an adjustment with the balancing. I rang up and arranged to take the car back with no problems. ""Tommy""went to check the off side front wheel first, and then changed his mind and did the near side. It was slightly out. He then did the off side and immediately he put the wheel on the balancing machine, he said the wheel was buckled and there was nothing he could do. He showed me the buckle and asked if I had hit a pot hole. (I had not) It was almost as if he knew what he was going to find. Somehow, it did not add up and I am now having to get the wheel straightened or at worst, get a new one."
Customer service very poor took me 2 hours of hanging on phone to get to finance department after you took payment for 2 tyres 4 times service sucks 😡😡😡
Great company. Easy to buy good selection tyres arrived prompt and fittedWould definitely use again
Excellent and effortless. First time I have used but will be back again. Got Goodyear tyres as per bmw spec when local tyre company offered an unknown name for the same costs
Excellent price and the mobile fitting service saved me a lot of hassle as my old tyre was completely flat and wouldn’t inflate making it impossible to get to a fitting centre. Good tyre and reasonable price
"good priced tyres, convieniently fitted at a local garage of your choice"
Took my car in and was well advised and supported by the staff.
First class service! Garage very efficient despite short of staff which caused slight delay!
Excellent value. Quick and easy. Will definitely use again
"Good prices, good service."
Very good website I do recommend for people to use.
Poor customer service. Tires did Not arrive for appointment contacted the night before but when order cancelled customer service was appalling took nearly 5 days to get refund processed after they had told me they had already done it
4 tyres fitted and less than an hour Can't complain at that
Good prices and excellent service from fitters.
"Competitively priced, very good service, tyre installers provided a great service, too, and gave good advice."
Great product as described and fantastic service fitting them at Pro-tyre. Happy to recommend
"Fantastic value, a great customer experience with the desired outcomes."
Excellent service thank you!
Very good customer service.Wide selection of products.Plenty of choice for fitting of tyres.
My family have used [REDACTED] a few times now. Amazing Prices for tyres and a great service supplied.I would also like to recommend the fitting garage.In my case I used Progress Motors in Wellingborough. Never been to them before but I found them to be really friendly and knowledgeable people. I met and spoke with the owner proprietor who again was a very nice man. They gave me feeling when leaving that they were a very friendly professional and honest garage. 11/10 for Progress Motors Wellingborough. Recommended!!!!
The whole experience from start to finish went very smoothly it's nice you can sit back in your own home and look at the various tyres and prices to get what you want then book a fitting slot to suit you and where you want to go as well great job thanks. Rich Thorne .
Always an excellent service.Chose the mobile home fitting service which was brilliant as a time was provided and they were prompt.
"All good, very friendly and efficient service"
"Easy, quick and saved me about 30%."
A very easy purchase. All aspects clearly presented and plenty of choice options.
Great service all ran to time minimum wait for fitting two tyres 35 mins thanks will use you again . Price was very competitive with a 10 % discount offer on Bridgestone
"Staff very friendly, offered a drink while i waited."
Easy to use website...Good Prices....You choose fitting appointment....Great service.
"The service I received was excellent, I have already recommended them to friends and family."
Second time I have used the mobile tyre fitting option (Glasgow) with [REDACTED] - Excellent service on a high end car.
"I was on holiday when I ordered my tyres, and with work commitments, my schedule was tough to fit in, different people at [REDACTED] got in tough with multiple garages for me to get the tyres fitted. Really great service"
Excellent would use them again
no problems or delays good service
"Good tyres, prices and service. My only small comment is that on the [REDACTED] (pink copy) of the Job Sheet it states ""wheel torque settings MUST be checked within 50 miles of the tyres being refitted"" However no mention if this work is included in the supply and fitting price for the tyres?"
"Good value, great service. I was very satisfied."
"This service was great! I chose the tyres I wanted online (which allowed me to read reviews and take my time), paid for them and chose a service professional to install them. I chose a date and time for them to come to me (using a mobile service) and they showed up as promised. They were professional, courteous, and very quick. I can't recommend this highly enough. It was much easier than going to the local garage - and it was a whole lot cheaper for the same tyres! (I know because I'd just had one done at the garage a few weeks prior.)"
Everything done on time and for a good price. Very happy with [REDACTED] and the service garage.
Shopped around and found [REDACTED] to be best price. Able to book fitting online with local garage. Would use again.
Tyres are cheaper than anywhere else and you can choose were to have them fitted
Very happy with service provided and product supplied
Outstanding service. From start to finish this was by far the best service I have used for my car. It was easy and cheap and will definitely return again. I have already told friends and family about [REDACTED] and look forward to using again in the future
Very competitive pricing and excellent local service
From placing the order to having tyres fitted was best service you could have. Kept informed at all times and on arrival at ATS for the appointed time was not kept waiting. Would certainly use again and recommend thoroughly
Very good n speedy service
Exceptional service from ordering through to fitting. Top class!
Booked tyres of my choice for fitting at my local ATS. Received several texts from ATS to remind me to attend at the appointed time. On the day the tyres were ready and fitted without any problems. Good choice of tyres when I booked and prices were competitive with other on-line offers. Have used [REDACTED] several times without any complaints and have always been satisfied with the service.
Highly recommend have used [REDACTED] 3 times
Straightforward courteous service - will use again. Thanks
"Easy online ordering, book a time for fitting, simple, first class service, will certainly use next time."
An excellent job done yet again. Keen prices and an exellent range plus a selection of fititng centers and quick availability makes for a happy customer!
Cheap and smooth. Thats how i like it
Vastly cheaper than the main tyre outlets and really efficient and easy to use. Highly recommend and communication is excellent.
"Fast efficient service. One change to the date and time I had originally submitted, but otherwise great tyres and excellent garage fitting. Stratford Tyres has good waiting area and the car was seen to as soon as I arrived."
Only thing that stopped me from giving 10 was the fact that when booking is wasn't clear that there wasn't a fixed time for the am or pm fitting appointment but that's being fussy. I got there at 8:30 and was all done by 9:30. Very good service.
"Such an easy, hassle free way to get new tyres. [REDACTED] book an appointment for you at your chosen fitting centre and deliver your choice of tyres ready for you. Just turn up for your appointment and that's it. So easy, [REDACTED] also very good at communicating with you too, they were unable to deliver my tyres on the day originally booked and liaised with me to arrange the best day for me and they rebooked my appointment. I will be using them for all future tyre needs, highly recommended."
"Easy booking service and good options close to my location this very convenient, the third time I've used this device and was very pleased again."
Top class tyres at a good price.
"Very easy to use, provides all the relevant information in one place. Excellent customer services, provided compensation for delayed delivery of tyres. Would highly recommend."
The garage had problems on the day our tyres were due to be fitted. The staff did not have a key to open up and we had to wait an hour for someone to turn up with one .Once inside they said the tyres were not there and to come back another day also their fitting machine had broken. A message to [REDACTED] was immediately acted upon confirming that the tyres were there and arranging another date. Eventually our tyres were fitted and they seem fine and [REDACTED] refunded some money for the inconvenience.So all in all I think [REDACTED] did a good job.
Excellent no reservations
"All worked really well, would use again"
As always! great helpful service after using [REDACTED] for the fifth time. I would and have recommended to my friends and family.
First time I have used [REDACTED]. Highly recommend them. Tyres arrived at my local garage and had them fitted promptly
The complete service and ease of choosing what tyres I wanted was exceptional.
"Great service, mobile fitting of two rear tyres completed in a very short time at a very reasonable price"
Fantastic deliver service well pleased with the tryes.EnamSutton Surrey
"I ordered the tyres online at the weekend and after choosing the tyres and the fitter I was given the option of time on the following Thursday.I could either have the morning or the afternoon on a first-come first-served basis. I chose a morning slot and turned up at about 10.30.On arrival I was told the tyres were not there yet so left the car with fitters and walked nearly 3 miles home ( I need the exercise anyway)I later got a phone call to say the car was ready tyres had been fitted and returned to get the car.The tyres are fine, a [REDACTED] recommendation.that the tyres weren't actually at the fitters four days after ordering was disappointing hence the three stars rather than five. I should at least have been notified that the tyres would not be there in the morning and I would have rearranged a different day for the fitting."
"Everything was ready when I went for the fitting, very good service"
Easy to get the tyres you want.
The whole process from start to finish was very easy and straightforward. Would most definitely use [REDACTED] again.
Great service great price 👍
"I ordered the tyres from [REDACTED] as they were cheaper than Kwik fit, who I've used in the past. An appointment was offered at a time and day to suit me with a local tyre fitting company. I arrived at the depot the tyres were fitted and I was out and on my way within 30 minutes"
Great service delivery and fitted to car as ordered on- line.
"ordered another pair of the tyres at a good price for them to be delivered to a local garage to fit them, sorted :)"
"Fast and efficient service, would use this company for my next tyre change"
"Booked tyres and timeslot through [REDACTED] but when I turned up was turned away as my car hadn't been booked in, I lost a couple of hours pay as left work early to get my tyres fitted, wasn't happy! Had to go back another day."
"Great service, which I always use."
"Very good service, although not too keen on being called ""love"" all the time and having my back patted.The tyres were as ordered, and all four were replaced in one hour.What a pity Swan Garage has to endure that ghastly car park.Price wise - excellent."
"Value for money, fantastic choice of products"
"Great service. Was harassed by email to leave a review. So here it is. 5/5 service, 1/5 after service harassment. Meet you half way, 3/5. Stop it."
"Reliable cost effective way to buy tyres. I've used [REDACTED] several times and never been let down. Simple, cost effective way of buying tyres. The website is easy to use - simply eneter details of your vehocle, select the tyres and garage you wish to use, pay and that's it. You'' get an email confirming your order, and your appointment. Simple and reliable."
"Easy, cheap and discounted"
"An excellent easy to use website with different search options leading to a focussed selection. The garage they partner with near me were extremely professional, friendly and efficient. An obviously well thought out customer journey and when i had a question was able to talk with a British based team. Brilliant"
Easy To use. Fitting dates at local fitting center a bit long.
Used twice so far. Swift delivery and v competitive pricing. Works well with ATS Taunton. Happy to recommend.
"Kartechnic, really good service would recommend every time."
Good service and kept up to date with progress of job as it was going to take longer than normal.
hassle free and practical
"Great experience - received the tyre and it was fitted exactly as expected, good price too."
Good service - good price
The simplest process from beginning to end .
Great service and excellent price.
[REDACTED] is the best way to buy new tyres for your car. The range and value can’t be beaten and the also choosing which garage you want to have them fitted at us a brilliant idea. There is no sales pressure when you turn up which makes a change. Will be using them again in the future.
"Very easy to use, works well. Will definitely use again in the future.excellent"
Very happy.great and pleasant service.
"Quality tyres and a great price, fitting was done by the appointed garage at the arranged time. I would use this service again!"
"Great company, quick service, user friendly website, will definitely use again."
The customer service and fitting at the garage was excellent. I would recommend [REDACTED] website to my friends and family
Choosing tyres on the website was straightforward and easy and a decent price was a bonus
Ordered 2 Bridgestone tyres to be fitted by local garage. Choice of fitting days and times. No problems with service from start to finish. Excellent service and happy with choice of tyre and price.
"Garage service wonderful! Price competitive but review is only 3 stars mainly because the 2 4x4 tyres that I had fitted were actually manufactured four years ago, so the cheaper price was all down to the tyres being old stock! Although the tyre is classed as usable and can be sold and fitted up to 5 years from manufacture, if I had known beforehand the age of the tyres supplied I would have shopped elsewhere, disappointed."
Quick and very easy tyre replacement
Awesome Price! Awesome Service! Definitely would recommend to everyone! Happy days 🙂
Code for discount on purchasing four tyres is confusing.
"Great company to deal with good price for quality product, always do what they promise"
"Excellent service, x4 tyres was replaced within a short space of time. And through [REDACTED] was certainly a lot cheaper.."
All completed on time and very efficiently.
Fantastic and incredibly efficient in addition to saving over forty quid
"Booked the tyres to be fitted by a mobile tyre fitter at my home as I wanted to keep the tyres already on the car. The first appointment was missed as the tyres hadn't arrived in stock in time. This was very frustrating as I wanted the new tyres for a road trip I was taking to Scotland. We arranged to have the tyres fitted the following Saturday AM. At 11 o'clock that morning I received a call from the tyre fitters saying they hadn't received tyres from [REDACTED] (not true) and could they fit them tomorrow morning instead (Sunday). I said yes. The next day the tyre fitters didn't show up and I received no call whatsoever. I called them at around 4:45pm. They said they had broken down on the motorway and were going to call me that evening? I spoke to [REDACTED] who were deeply apologetic and arranged for the tyres to be fitted the following Saturday. I asked them not to use the same mobile tyre fitter as I didn't trust them but they did. The following Saturday arrived and once again, no one showed. I called [REDACTED] who called the tyre fitters. Once again the tyre fitters said they wouldn't be able to get to me and asked if they could come on Sunday again instead. Obviously I told them where to go. In the end we agreed that a local fitter to me would fit the tyres this Saturday. I went there and all appeared well. However when I collected the car some of the lacquer from two front wheels had been scuffed off! The tyre fitters came up with the reasons why but didn't actually apologise or accept blame. They said they will have a look at it this Friday. It's fair to say I have now given in. To be fair, throughout this whole situation, [REDACTED] customer service has actually been very good, especially from their call centre staff, and they have compensated me at each missed appointment. The problem is that there is a big issue with the tyre fitters they use/in general and I would not recommend whatsoever, having your tyres mobile fitted in the Leeds/Bradford area as this is the only mobile tyre fitter [REDACTED] use."
Would use again very quick and reasonably priced.
Great site for tyres. Easy to use and easy to order and book. Tyres actually arrived earlier than expected and fitted earlier
"Let down twice on availability, on offering alternative fitment options via e-mail had no response.Have used BC over many years and this is the first problem encountered."
"Quick, smooth transaction & professional garages. All at all inclusive best price. Been using them for last 4-5 years now. Always best"
"Excellent service , tyres delivered on time and fiited by fitting partner on time"
Tyres fitted on the day with no issues
Well priced great service
"Ease of use, tyres replaced with any fuss."
Excellent service very competitive prices and appointed garage pleasant and efficient with no extra charges. Makes a nice change.
"Easy to book, best price I could find for the quality of tyre and service from the fitting garage was good."
"I have used [REDACTED] on two separate occasions, firstly for new front tyres and more recently for new rear tyres. Such an easy process, tyres fitted no issues at all at convenient location. Would recommend for anyone to use."
Excellent service fitting 4 very good value tyres in under 45 minutes.
"Whole process very easy start to finish, and at a very good price. Tyres fitted by the Manager, Barney, at a time convenient to me. Third time I have used [REDACTED], will use them in the future."
"Great service, good price with only one fault. 4 day wait have them fitted."
Easy to use website. Competitive prices. Good information on tyres. Ability to book nearby garage for fitting and suitable date and time. Friendly helpful customer services to resolve problems. Excellent communications.
"Excellent, straightforwards service"
Only site I will use to buy my tyres. Easy to navigte around the website and I can choose a garage near my work place or home.
The job was completed in a decent time frame to a good standard despite being very busy.
"First class,quality work delivered on time by people who clearly knew what they were doing"
"Tyre fitted at Jim Dickson Tyres in Cumbernauld Village. No issues at all, would recommend going here."
Best price. Top service. What's not to like!
Straight forward from start to finish. Thank you.
"Best prices, quick delivery. Highly recommended"
"Simple as can be, great price, great communication and best of all got them fitted at my local trusted ATS Euromaster, Burton on Trent"
"Went very well, everything done as stated on time"
"This was the first time I’d used [REDACTED] and I will definitely use them again!So easy to order and pay for my tyre and to choose the garage.I was kept informed by email throughout the process. The whole procedure was easy, simple and painless!Highly recommend."
Great service and value
Bought my tyre on line the service was good and they delivered to my choice tyre fitter on time.
The prices are excellent and they use good local fitting centers.
Always had good dealings fair prices and service good
"Easy, no nonsense process.Fitting dealers just gave me the option to leave car in morning or afternoon which meant that I had to leave the car and go back, otherwise no issues."
Excellent service and cheaper than anywhere else!
"Arrived on time and fitted four new tyres at a competitive cost on my driveway at home,saving my time taking the vehicle to a garage and waiting for possibly an hour or more for tyres to be fitted. Cannot fault the price or the service."
"Excellent service,will be using these again."
It all went through very smoothly
Great tyres & no problems getting them.
"Great price and very friendly service, nice and local"
Good prices simple system
Easy to find the garage. Friendly reception.
No problems throughout
My original chosen time/date couldn’t be honoured because only ONE of my TWO tyres were delivered.My second time/date couldn’t be honoured because they did not have the 2nd tire in stock.So I was offered another tyre make and a new fitting date. On the plus side they did kept me updated after the initial appointment.
"quick, easy and good price able to use a tyre garage that I had used before"
Bloody marvelous..me and the wife are well chuffed 🙂👍
I booked for 2 front tires at the local garage and arrived early at the garage next day and they were done within 45 minutes. Excellent service from [REDACTED] and the Garage.
I was able to buy a top branded tyre at a good price.Tyres were fitted when they said they would be and the tyre fitting garage were very professional. I am very happy that I used [REDACTED] and will definitely be buying my tyres from them again..
An excellent service with friendly staff. Offered coffee and biscuit while I waited for the tyres to be fitted.
"Not a great experience so far. Still waiting for a missing tyre from my order. It seems “chat” to a team member actually means send an e-mail....not quite the same thing! No replies from that as yet.Help line merrily racks up a premium cost whilst you wait....I bailed out just after 5 mins before it cost me any more money.I feel very isolated as a customer with an issue right now.When things go wrong [REDACTED] don’t appear to meet the standards of customer care that we have come to expect from a major online retailer, particularly one owned by a company as reputable as Michelin."
"Great tyres at competitive price.Would have scored five stars, but, it looks as though the front tyres will need rebalancing.I‚Äôve used [REDACTED] before and are my preferred choice."
Price was competitive but tyre delivery to fitters was delayed. On the plus side they did let me know
Everything advertised was done excellent service
"The purchase of the tyres was easy and simple and the tyres I choose were a good price however, the garage for the fitting was not good. The original booking was cancelled then booked again and that was cancelled then had to wait 2 weeks to get a date when I wasn't working and they could fit the tyres. When we actually went to get them done the garage was very quiet and kindly didn't inflate one of the tyres correctly so that evening when driving the car I had t ore inflate one of them to the correct pressure. Garage bad, tyres good."
Very responsive customer service. Gave me a full refund when I cancelled my order.
Great job very prompt
I found ordering tyres very easy from start to finish. A great range of tyres were available at extremely competitive prices which included fitting and at a date at a garage of my choice. Couldn't ask for anything more.
Good service !
Will definitely be using [REDACTED].com again.
"First time using [REDACTED] i was suppose to have my tyre fitted on the fiday i get a email to say they will not be fitted friday as my tyres did not turn up on time, then they email me friday afternoon to telle my tyres have finally tirn up amd to call then so i ring [REDACTED] on friday night the lady told me that she will sort my tyres out and phone the garage Saturday as soon as it open at 10am to see when i could have my tyres fitted then phone me to tell me as soon as she know a time and day but she's never ring me back so i waited till Tuesday still no call from balck circle so on Wednesday i phone the garage myself and finally got a booking to have my tyres fitted i was not happy with this service"
I bought two tyres for my T4 and saved £30. Process online worked well and efficiently. The service at the garage was real fast and prompt though the staff could do with some customer training. Overall very happy.
Friendly staff...very helpful ...
Very straightforward website and good customer service when the appointment didn’t quite go to plan
"The booking process was simple and choosing a local garage for a specific time slot felt like a ‘win win’ situation.However, I don’t think an hour to fit two new tyres is acceptable, with no apology or explanation. It appeared that this is the ‘norm’ for bookings made via a third party site like [REDACTED] and not directly with the garage themselves - can’t say they seemed happy to receive the additional business, so why sign up to this scheme???I need two more tyres soon, but as the savings are not that great I’ll book direct at my usual fitter, so at least I know it will take half the time - I can’t even say it was a lack of fitters as there were at least 3. I’d say a lesson learned the hard way, which is a shame as it seemed like a good idea at the time, but the customer service was let down by the garage."
After discovering '[REDACTED]' I wouldn't go anywhere else
No issues. Everything was to a standard I would hope for when dealing with a member of the public.
Have used [REDACTED] before and like the service.I like the ability to review a wide range of tyre choices on the website before making my choice rather than the limited selection you would get at a garage. Then you can book your time slot and place to have the tyres fitted. The fitters have always been very good too.Will definitely use again.
Got the tyres I wanted at a competitive price with no hassle having them fitted. 😊
"Needed tyres. Ordered them and within a couple of days had them on my car.What more do you want?Easy does it, no fuss.Will use service again xxx"
Two words just about sum it up... THE BEST
"Excellent web site, easy to arrange and good prices"
"This was a simple, fuss-free system to use. I found a wide variety of tyre options to choose with many locations to choose from at a date and time of my choice too which is great!The service delivery on the day was professional, i was given a full checklist to keep as well which is handy.The customer service team emailed with confirmations of my booking as assisted with a time change A faultless service experience."
"Easy to book on line great customer service when I had to call them, Service at the centre could be better actual work carried out was fine but customer service could be better by fitters."
"[REDACTED].com was recommended to me by my brother, so I decided to give them a try. The pricing was very competitive and the service provided by my local tyre fitter was very good too. I will definitely be using them again."
On time service and did everything as agreed
Great service! I just picked my choice of tyres and got a great 15% discount. I then chose a great affiliate garage 2 miles away and the job was done in half hour. I was able to choose the slot most suitable for me too. Very satisfied indeed. I also had lots of choice of tyres to choose from at good prices.
good selection of tyres; good prices; recommended a great local shop for fitting
Rotella RH01 fitted on MG ZS. Good rating with pleasing performance at budget end price. Well fitted and balanced by Gilmar Motor Engineers in Molesey. First try of [REDACTED].com seems a good experience!
2nd time I've had tyres fitted here and the service is friendly and professional.
Great service and easy to use. Definitely recommend.
Used many times before but never again. Ordered my tyres and selected my fitting date. Got an email to delay fitting date by 4 days because they claimed they couldn't get the tyres in that time. Arrived at selected garage on rearranged day and time and tyres hadn't arrived. Rang customer services and was told that the tyres were on the van and would be delivered later that day sometime. Fitting garage said they can get the tyres for the following day so I cancelled the [REDACTED] order and told the garage to order them in. They were paid for the tyres almost a week earlier but told me a refund would take 3-5 days. Told them this wasn't acceptable and the refund must be made that day. Tyres were fitted mid-day the following day and was told that the [REDACTED] tyres were delivered at the same time as the ones they ordered. I paid a 2% premium to get the tyres from a local garage but only pay when the job is finished. No brainer!
Excellent prices and availability of local fitters. Have used before and will use again; my tyre supplier of choice!.
Good service and job well done!
"Great service, knowledge and sound advice given for the future. Will always use this company."
"I initially reviewed [REDACTED] at one star for the absolutely dismal service and treatment i received from ATS Cannock. I can honestly say where ATS failed (in every way), [REDACTED].com have stepped up, their customer service is fantastic. Hopefully, on a normal transaction you'll have little to do with [REDACTED].com as you'll purchase through their website and hand everything over to your chosen garage. However, should you have any issues, [REDACTED].com customer service will exceed anything offered from a garage and adds a layer of protection. I honestly will never buy tyres again without using [REDACTED].com. This experience has taught me things can go very wrong very quickly and although i hope this experience will not be repeated, i'll always feel much better knowing [REDACTED].com are there to help."
Easy to use their site and arrange for tyres to be fitted at a local garage very pleased and will use them again
Early days but the tyres appear ok. My concern was that they were delivered to the fitting garage squashed. The tyre fitter had great difficulty fitting and inflating them. Their blasting machine was broken so they had to get one from somewhere else. Finally fitted after 3 hours. Fitting should have been around 1 hour.
Smooth transaction and efficient service. Highly recommended.
"If like me, you are contemplating buying tyres online, but are a little unsure, I can recommend [REDACTED]. From choosing the tyres I wanted, at a very good price, to having them fitted at a local garage, the whole process was very easy and efficient. I will certainly be using them again."
faultless service from ordering to fitting.Would recommend them to everyone.
"I had a good experience with [REDACTED] - they had the best price for what I wanted and their fitting centre was local. I did offer the centre the work directly but the could not come near the price, which was a bit sad for me. I wonder whether they get enough from their links to [REDACTED]. I expect that this sort of service will see many a small tyre retailer leave the market place."
"Well priced and the lady in the office was brilliant trying to accommodate my requested time for fitting, ATS were also excellent."
"Excellent and easy to arrange, will definitely use again and recommend."
Great prices and fantastic service from my local mobile fitter.
The website was easy to use. There were a good choice of tyres and the fitters that were on the website were very good. I have already recommended this site to my friends.
great service and low price from our local garage
"Tyre Tastick. Really easy way to pick, pay for car tyres and the choice to have them fitted with local garage was brilliant.The value for money is excellent"
"Same tyres as garages but cheaper! Easy to purchase online, price paid includes everything with no extras to pay. Pick your local garage and a time to suit for fitting. Just purchase online and turn up. It's that easy."
Easy service to use and a price I can afford 👍🏻
Very prompt and and efficient
A+++ Service!!!! Cheapest on the net
Good price and good overall quick service
The tyres are really good quality and it was great being able to chose a date and time that suited me. They were a great price as well.
"Great online service and I used ATS as recommend local fitter.I also used [REDACTED] own tyre brand which are excellent value for money, way better than alternative cost effective tyres. Many thanks"
Good straightforward cheep service and a good number of fitting centres
I am a returning customer and as always a great service at a very competitive price.
Excellent service. Will definitely be using this company again. One of the cheapest for top brand tyres.
Good quality tyres at a sensible price plus spot on service
Simply to use and really good value.
Ordered wrong tyres on line and telephoned to cancel my order they were very good and returned the money to my card reordered the correct tyres booked the day to get them fitted arrived at garage the car was taken at the time booked and 1hour later the car was returned all 4 tyres fitted exactly as ordered very good service
Easy to use and nice to be able to review the statistics on a wide selection of tyres and being able to take the time to decide which set to go for.
Excellent service and the garage was fantastic as well. Five stars *****I have a friend who has a friend who works in a garage and he couldn't beet the price.
"I have previously used [REDACTED] a few years ago with no problems so decided to use them again. Booking 4 new tyres for my Audi Q3 was easy and booked a time slot at their ‘recommended’ garage, so far so good.So turned up 15 mins before the due time as requested and walked in only to be greeted with “the car wash is outside”, after pointing out I was there for 4 new tyres was told “oh sorry” and asked for my name then to be told they were busy so there might be a delay. So not the greeting I would have expected and why give a time slot then not adhere to it?Anyway there were two other customers in front of me in the waiting room when the manager came out and told them both exactly the same thing, their tracking was out but it can be rectified for a special price of £38 (approx as can’t remember exactly). After the other customers had left the manager came out and gave me exactly the same pitch about the tracking, and the special price of £38 (I check my tyres regularly and had not seen any signs of uneven wear) so declined ......... call me a cynic but 3 people in a row all with exactly the same pitch about tracking? Seems unlikely to me and a way of getting another £38 out of people.So after approx 1hr 15 mins I left the garage all completed and apart from the above all seemed ok.Not using the car that much due to a few days off it was parked up. 4 days & less that 75 miles later I got a tyre presser alert and on checking found all the tyres had been over inflated 42psi instead of 36psi.Moving on to 6 days later and around 150 miles later noticed that the F/N/S wheel has a nut missing, the locking wheel nut was gone so checked the others & found the F/O/S wheel had 2 x nut covers missing and the locking nut was loose and could be turned with your fingers.I immediately went to the garage and to be fare they ordered a replacement set of locking nuts without much quibbling and 90 mins later went back for them to be replaced BUT as they were a patterned replacement the nut covers did not fit so now I have the 4 locking wheel nuts without covers and one of the standard nuts without a cover. The managed did say he would order a replacement set and then get them to fit but why should I settle for second bast. My car was in purse to condition when I went in for the tyres and due to their error has left me with non standard locking wheel nuts and covers missing - not happy!!Overall the whole experience with this garage is poor to say the least and I would never use them again. Come on [REDACTED] this garage is doing you a disservice sort it out!"
Superb service.
Prompt and polite service.
Easy and efficient service to use
Great choice of tyres at a competitive price fitted at a garage near you
Competitive price and good choice of garages
Fast service quickly ironed out any issues / double check tyre size when ordering as not all that come up from your number plate will fit your car (as I found out !) they where very good and replace the tyres for me immediately with no extra cost - overall great service and a reliable company
"the whole process - searching, booking paying couldnt be easier, and with a decent range of tyres at good prices - often discounted. Its a really good business model. Flexibility with date time and location. Very please with my two Bridgestones and will use [REDACTED] again."
Straightforward ordering process.Good prices and great customer service.Have been a regular customer for several years.
Extremely good service
An excellent experience from ordering and through out the fitting of the tyres. Would definitely recommend [REDACTED] and macconechy for fitting. Thanks
"I have bought tyres twice from [REDACTED].The second time, the 2 tyres provided developed a fault after 9 months, through no fault of [REDACTED].[REDACTED] communicated very well with me, and replaced the faulty tyres promptly (albeit for a small charge for the wear already on the faulty tyres).I can thoroughly recommend their service."
"Easy to pick tyres, easy to book in, and the local garage I went to was excellent. Tyres were pumped up and bolts were torqued to manufacturer spec and I wasn’t left with white tyre sealer all over the sidewalks.Great service and will continue to do this for my vehicles in the future."
Ordered some tyres using the system where I just put my car reg in. Unfortunately this didn’t work and came up with different size tyres than what I already have. I didn’t notice and ordered anyway. Luckily once noticed at the garage I contacted customer support and they were very quick to sort everything out. Very friendly team. New tyres seem great. Would use again. Thanks
Economical and reliable service
Easy and relaxing experience with helpful and efficient staff. After a short walk in Ayr the car was ready with all 4 tyres replaced and ready to go.
Excellent service. Highly recommend.
A great Servo‚Äôs no fuss or pushing you to buy other products
Booking was good and easy and the staff st the garage was excellent. Could not give 5 stars as the client waiting area in the garage was the dirtiest and most unwelcome place I have seen in years. Did most bother me too much bug they should really make an effort!
This is the only Tyre Company I use
"Speedy service, great price. I would definitely use them again and highly recommend"
"I made the booking to ensure my tyres were fitted at a time convenient for me prior to my MoT. Less than 24hours before my time slot I was emailed to be told that [REDACTED] wouldn’t be able to honour my booking and had rebooked me for 2 days later, after my MoT. As this was unacceptable I phoned up to find out why the booking had to be rescheduled. I was told that only one of my tyres was available and I then spent the rest of the afternoon trying to negotiate getting an alternative solution so as to make my MoT booking. Ultimate [REDACTED] couldn’t honour my booking and I had to reschedule my MoT to a time after their estimated delivery date of the other tyre. Very disappointed that [REDACTED] took my booking and money without being sure they could deliver on their promise. Very annoyed."
IT WOULD BE HARD TO IMPROVE ON THE SERVICE I HAD.FAST DELIVERY AND FITTING SERVICE.JUST PERFECT.
Nice and smooth. Was a bit concerned about the agent changing the tyres but that was remarkably smooth as well.
Great deals on tyes.
Excellent. Well done
"[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy's, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy's customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy's fitted my tyres (although I'm very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy's had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy's about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated ""but I changed the valve cores though"".I don't believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn't know, is that I'm a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn't notice McConechy's had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn't change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that's why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don't believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn't it ? NO, it certainly doesn't !Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a toque wrench. The McConechy's tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy's customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden."
"An easy way to buy tyres. I did find the same tyres a little cheaper elsewhere online but the approved [REDACTED] fitting station was a lot closer to me than options offered by other websites. The local garage I choose was excellent, quick, polite and professional."
Excellent value tyres and loved how convenient it was to book a fitting at a time and place of my suiting.
"From point of order through to garage fitting of tyres, everything went smoothly, with constant updates via email. Garage was local to where we lived, less than 10 miles away, and fitted according to allocated slot. Great."
very easy site to use and order. garage was waiting with the tyres. very happy.
Good choice of tyres and competative pricing. Didn't give it 5 stars as there was an issue with the appointment time for fitting. I had been informed 9.30 and the fitting centre 10.30
Easy process and best price.
Very easy to book and arranged booking. All went very well Thank you
"Couldn't of been easier, very happy with service, I will definitely use again."
"Great service, easy & affordable"
"Friendly, quick, easy and good quality service"
The process was smooth and John Barton Garage were highly professional and efficient.
"[REDACTED] service was, as usual, great. However I gave 2 choices of fitting venues, St Andrews for some reason was unable to accept me so I was given ATS Dundee.... Arrived around 1.4t for 2pm appointment. Returned approx 2.30, car on ramp but wheels still on. 3.05 fitter standing at side of car, blind side for me, he never moved for just over 3 minutes. When I pointed this out to management, he said the fitter ead doing the paperwork. Oh, by the way, I was an engineering work process auditor and H & S advisor for many years.... Anyway not happy with this and have notified [REDACTED]. Will still continue to use BCs and my local fitters, they are good at customer service."
"Very good service, fitter also pointed out that I required a new spring."
Great price very fast service will use again.
"I went through [REDACTED] to get 2 new front tyres. I thought it was hassle free and any easy way to book to get my tyres done. However, 2 days before I was due to go to my chosen garage I received a phone call from [REDACTED] to say that my chosen garage couldn’t now fit me in. They had to ring around 2 other local garages before they could find me another garage that would fit me in 2 days later than my original appointment. Although this may not have been [REDACTED] fault this was very stressful for me as my car had already failed the MOT hence why I booked my car in ASAP! The lady I spoke to on the phone who rang round other garages was very helpful but it was a very stressful situation to be in. I don’t think I will use this service again, I will just go through the garage themselves."
Simply excellent as always.
Excellent pricing with first class products and easily accessible fitting at top workshop.
"Great price and great service, garage was lovely with great coffee"
"Easy to arrange, wide choice and good value"
Easy to use with local fitting.
"Such an easy service to use,you can choose from a range of tyres from budget to top brands cheaply. Then your booked to your local tyre fitters & you pre pay on the [REDACTED] website. Will defenately use again. Very happy."
Great user friendly and competitively priced service
Once again the service and value were great.
Simple to organise ...reasonably priced.
Fantastic price for our new tyres. Hassle free from start to finish. Great experience and would highly recommend to anyone wanting new tyres to make [REDACTED].com the first port of call!
Prices good & the fitting went very smoothly with Castle Car Care!
The process ran smoothly from booking on line to dropping off and picking up as arranged. |Friendly staff at the local ATS carrying out the replacement added to the experience. second time I have used them and will go back.
"Whole process was easy from start to finish, friendly mobile fitter arrived as planned and did a good, quick job."
"Good value tyres, delivered and fitted on time, a few fitting marks on my alloys😞"
A great selection of tyres with good prices and fitting options. I was very happy with the mobile fitting service that came to me home.
An easy and quick transaction
Took two goes to physically order the correct set for my Car - but they did resolve after a long hold on the phone. Still an expensive purchase - but these guys were competitive. ATS Fitters was another story - couldn't print an invoice in under 1 hour - so had to leave and chase for it later
No problems. Great service
Easy to find the tyres I wanted and a local installation. Could not be simpler.
"This is a really convenient and cost effective way to buy new tyres. The website is clear, easy and secure. Simply enter the details of your ehcile, select the tyres and the garage you would like to use, pay, and that's it. Easy and reliable. Have used [REDACTED] several times and never been let down."
very good would use again
Best prices for tyres with various places to choose from at a time which suits the buyer to get the tyres fitted.
All pretty normal really...Said it would be done in 15 mins (actually took 40 (no complications)).Very polite to the customers (reading from the script) but not too sure about being respectful to each other in front of the customers?However the job was done and I will use them again due to the convenience of the location.
"easy and simple website, quick and clear response via sms and always a simple process when dealing with tyre fitters"
"The garage put a new tyre on the wheel but didn't put the wheel on the car so had to do this myself. I've never had to do that before and would expect betterI contacted [REDACTED] who offered a partial refund in compensation and are investigating the issue. I'm glad they were able to help solve this, and won't downgrade them for the fault of the garage"
"Simple, easy, savibg time, effort and money. £44 to be exact."
"Excellent – no reservations, I would recommend this company to anyone."
"Great price, much cheaper than main dealer or Kwikfit, took longer than they said they would, and it was raining with little cover."
Top of the range tyre from top of the range website!
Faultless Service. i have used [REDACTED] for a number of years and cannot fault them for quality or price or service. Highly recommended
"Good value tyres, great garage / fitters"
"Great service and good prices.I have fitted Michelin Pilot Sport 4 to my car, they are a great improvement over the Bridgestones that were originally on the car."
Easy to order from the website. Tyres fitted at my chosen fitter with no problem. I have used [REDACTED] before and always found their prices competitive and the fitting has always been straightforward
Great service .Staff are polite and helpful .great prices
Very easy to do and book your car in
"This company is totally DogDoo, apparently I can’t use more accurate words to describe the service they provided me and accuracy of my order, because [REDACTED] don’t like it, I wish BC would have taken as much interest in my order and getting it right, as they have done with the trustpilot reviews their many unhappy customers leave."
The easy way to purchase tyres
Disappointed that on collection to be told that tracking is out and to re-book to have it corrected. Go elsewhere to have it fixed and not waste my time again.
Couldn't fault them - fine on all counts
Convenient and cheaper than what the tyre shop could offer.
Great service no issues at all
Taken on time .prompt friendly service .waiting room with coffee and tea facilities of requirs
"Fuss-free buying and fitting of tyres. Will definitely use again, as prices are favourable, in addition to the convenience of online ordering and booking."
Excellent. Used the one at the big Tesco in Handforth. The lad working that Sat. morning couldn't have been more helpful. I would certainly use them again.
Arrived at the fitting centre at the confirmed time slot only to find that tyres hadn’t been delivered.Received refund.
They knew the manufacturer recommended levels for torque and tyre pressure when completing the work at the [REDACTED] Pitstop in Grays. Very professional service.
Easy to select. Easy to book convenient appointment.
"Easily booked. No waiting on the day. Good, clean job done. Straightforward process at the best price."
Good service getting the tyres fitted but disappointed the first garage I booked in at couldn't fit because too busy so therefore had to take elsewhere.
Good prices quick reliable service
Excellent except the garage said i had been double-booked by [REDACTED] and kept me waiting 40 minutes. I suspect that this was not the case and they were trying to fit in extra jobs.Next time I will double check my appointment with the garage
Very easy to buy the correct tyres and get them fitted at a local garage. Very pleased and would use again!
"Quick tyre replacement, both front tyres off changed and replaced with a free break check within the hour and they’re budget tyres are well worth choosing over a named brand."
Remi from Ackland tyres was great. He rang to confirm arrival time and was pleasant and professional.
Good professional service.
"Turned up on the wrong day, but they still managed to fit me in. Very impressed"
Very helpful and pleasant staff delivery on time would recommend to anyone prices very good too .
"Managed to catch a flash sale, so got 10% off an already competitive price for a pair of Michelin tyres.Able to pick a convenient time and location for fitting. No hassles at all. Highly recommended."
Very good service. Easy to use website and confirmation from the agent once the appointment made. Good options to select from a number of local agents. Good service from the agent also. Would recommend. Have used [REDACTED] twice now.
Every time I use them it just works.....
Fast friendly service had pm appointment arrived 11.45 2front tyres changed back on road 12.15 excellent service at great price
"Very easy to use website, good quality tyres. Fitting was hassle free and tyres fitted within an hour. Will use this method next time I need new car tyres and would recommend this website to anyone."
Took too long to change a tyre had a one hour slot arrived 5 minutes before appointment had to wait 90 mins to change the tyre
"Found what I wanted, good price and fitted locally to me."
"Ordered, garage fitted and I drove off. Job done."
Easy to book. I needed to change the time and it was done well as well. It is good to be able to do locally and price also is much better. Any free extras are not been taken care by the local fitter.
Hi the service very good and helpful thanks for your help today
"Used [REDACTED] for the first time.Arrived at the appointed fitters and all done in 15-20 minutes. Most impressed and will most certainly use them again, 10 out of 10!"
Great service alround
Easy and straight forward purchase Massive savings of £136 against my local garage for four tyresGreat communication
"Paid for a Tyre with a certain quality as per the EU labeling, what was actually fitted was far poorer. Customer service tried to state that EU labeling differs per manufacturer, upon stating back to them this is not the case I've failed to get any response from [REDACTED]. Will not be using again & would not recommended their own selection of tires."
Very competitive price . Excellent service
"After having BMW quote me almost £400 for 2 new rear tyres for my car, I went on [REDACTED] after a friend recommended them. I got my 2 tyres and got them fitted at an independent garage. Saved almost £130 in the process. Very very happy. Next day delivery and came in perfect condition. 5 stars"
"A good value service, however, my the service quality was not good. The original issue was my own error in that I ordered a wrong tyre size, however, the rectification process was very drawn out with several issue which was a shame as the get it right first time service is good."
"After initial problem the customer service was amazing, they could not do enough to get my tyres fitted at my convenience. Next time any of the family need tyre [REDACTED] will be my first call"
"Superb experience, would 100% recommend. as a young woman ordered tyres online, arrange to be delivered to designated garage then just dropped in and had fitted, all within a few clicks, and very reasonable priced."
"What can I say... I'm a typical girl! The only thing that usually concerns me about my car is the 'pretty' colour!... 😏... so, when it comes to getting new tyres for my Hyundai Tucson, I was clueless! Anyway, I popped onto [REDACTED] website and I can honestly say it was one of the best experiences ever!!! I literally put in my number plate and up popped a bunch of tyres at various prices from budget to high end! The price included delivery to a local garage, VAT and fitting and took me about 5 minutes from start to finish. I paid online and then got two emails, one confirming payment and the other to arrange fitting. I did this online too from the link in the email which showed me several garages in my area... I went to my appointment 3 days later at 9am (my choice, they could have done it even sooner!) and they were waiting for me with my two new tyres! Fantastic service and attention from start to finish. I have recommended [REDACTED] to so many people since... and also the garage that fitted them, HiQ in Stocton Road, Guildford. First class service and you've got me as a customer for life now! Thank you so much."
The process works in the way it is intended and you know for sure the tyres have been delivered before you get there. Fast and efficient.
Good prices. Tyres arrived on time at fitters who put them on at the time I chose. What's not to like?
Very efficient & quick service at a competative price. Would definitely use them for future tyre replacements.
"It was so easy to do,and getting them fitted was no problem at all.It was all sorted out for me.Great service"
"Great timely service. I found large range of tyres from various price range. Selected the tyres with fitting, and everything was arranged on the day. No hassle, this is my preferred way changing tyres now."
Quick and Easy - Great Value - Would recommend to anyone!
Very good price and everything happened as planned.
"I found the tyre I wanted on [REDACTED], cheaper than anywhere else. Easy to order & it was delivered to the garage of my choice. Would definitely recommend."
Great prices. There was a delay with the tyre delivery but the customer service team contacted me straight away and rearranged to another suitable time with no trouble at all.
"Good tyres, Good service"
"Excellent range, prices and service. First time I have used [REDACTED] and I am now converted. Delivered to my local garage and installed within a one hour time slot all pre-paid online."
"cheapest service, quick, will buy in future again"
Excellent price and fitted in allotted time
Mobile fitter was very quick and efficient
"good choice,good price, easy to do"
"Laws tyres in Aberdeen went the extra mile to ensure I left 100% happy with the tyre fitting, wheel balance and steering geometry adjustments that I required."
Great price and very nice people at the fitting garage. I had 2 x rear tyres fitted on my 19” rims and it was all done in 40mins.
"Excellent price,couldnt find cheaper. However ATS left part of the old weights on my wheels so i have since discovered when i cleaned my car"
"Fast service, good price and great local service"
"First time I had considered buying on line, but with such good prices, clear pricing and local free fitting thought I would give it a try. Glad I did, so impressed have just ordered another two tyres for the front"
2nd request for this review - excellent price for set of 4 Good Years. Paid for fitting etc so tyres were delivered to selected local tyre stockist where they were already waiting at my appointment time.Good service also at the tyre dealers. All in a very good deal and overall service. Would definitely use again.
good prices & excellent service
Great company to deal with
Very straightforward. Good Price. Garage was very courteous and prompt.
Excellent customer service. Went the extra mile to resolve me selecting the wrong size tyre for my car.
Excellent service and very straight forward
"Fantastic price, choose a local tyre fitter who were very good. I would definitely recommend"
"Very straight forward process, the selected date of fitting needed to be changed as the garage had no availability but it was dealt with very promptly and a new time was arranged."
It was an easy and excellent service and I got to choose some very good tyres at a very good price from a massive range of tyres and with reviews.
Cheapest I could find. Easy-to-use website with fitting bookable. Quick service. Excellent range of products to choose from.
"Good value for money, efficient and easy. Tyres - Sorted."
Still not received my tyres due Thursday last week. Never received any of my call back requests and sat for ages on hold to just never get through
"First time I've used [REDACTED], had a very positive experience. Very competitive prices, local fitting garage, tyres fitted in a timely manner by friendly efficient staff."
"Best prices , plenty of fitting centers, and easy to book, can’t be easierI have bought my last 3 sets of tyres through [REDACTED] for my Mercedes GLE"
Ordering process was simple enough. Competitive price. Fitting however was not without problems. Used Formula 1. Turned up at my allocated appointment time and they were too busy to fit me in. Ended up leaving the vehicle with them and returning 4 hours later.
Always a great service hence I keep coming back
"Great price, hassle free. Will be using again"
"Competitive, easy & reliable service!! Highly recommended."
All a very good experience. I used a tyre fitter that I have used many times in the past for peace of mind .
Very easy process to purchase and fit new tyres for my Suzuki Jimny
"The good news was that the tyres were a great price. Sadly ATS in Marlborough, who I rank very highly are currently very badly understaffed. Three customers turned away while I was there. Two engineers to run the workshop and reception. So tyre fitting took much longer than expected."
Very good service.will definitely use again.
"A fast, easy and efficient service coupled with competitive pricing."
easy use and good service
"Very good , fast and polite , on time , also the tires were not old stock, they were 2018 made which is very good"
"3rd time i've used , and again excellent service."
"Everything went exactly as arranged. The staff were friendly and helpful and the tyres are great, thanks."
Excellent service good prices good tyres excellent fitting all good.
Great service so simple to order tyres and I was very pleased with the garage that fitted then would definitely recommend
"Excellent, tyre arrived but was fitted after some time. I did have an issue at ATS as although I pre-booked and I arrived on time, the waiting time was too long.Well done [REDACTED]"
Great value and reliable service. Would recommend using [REDACTED] to everyone.
"Best company to deal with for tyres, easy and quick, highly recommend"
[REDACTED] charged me twice for my tyres (£1000) and took 1 week to pay it back.
"Fantastic service,would definitely use [REDACTED] again also midpoint for fitting my tyres they were great!."
This is the second time I’ve used [REDACTED] and both time I’ve been very pleased. Couldn’t find the tyres cheaper online anywhere else.
Would highly recommend
Great product and service is easy to access
"Easy to order and good choice of tyres, got confirmation straight away and they where fitted on time no problem. Would definitely recommend."
"Really easy to use, with a great choice of tyres. Also, I like the option to chose the garage of choice. Would recommend and use again."
I was able to save money on new tyres and found the support agent helpful. I'll be happy to use [REDACTED] again.
"Easy ordering,vast selection of tyres to suit all budgets. Ability to pick and choose fitting centre and time.All in all great service."
"Hello, easy to order and arrange fitting. Garage chosen by for second time in Bearsden, minded my last custom. Young technician Scott who fitted my tyres on both occasions very helpful and polite. Will use again with no worries! Francis"
"They swapped my delivery and payment address up so the fitters cancelled the job, then when spoke to [REDACTED] they got them to come out and be with me by 17:00-18:00. At 18:30 they hadn't arrived so phoned them direct, they said they were on another job, they'd come next morning at 09:00 at 09:45 they hadn't arrived so called direct again and they said they were only a few minutes away. They finally arrived at 10:30"
"So easy, best value, so convient could not wish for more"
Excellent and easy transaction. Did have to return to garage for a balancing problem but nothing to do with [REDACTED].
"Easy to use, wide choice, good price."
"Such a simple site to navigate, great choice of manufacturers and very good pricing. Even better the garage was only 1 mile from home! Excellent service at Mackenzie & Haywards, as always, comfy sofa, practical classics magazine and a coffee machine.........living the dream!😁"
"Very good service, would highly recommend!"
The best tyres at the best prices!
Tyres ordered on Friday. Fitted on Saturday early so I arrived at the.fitters at 7.45 am and left at 9.15am with the tyres I had purchased at very competitive prices fitted perfectly and subsequentl running has confirmed balanced and inflated correctly. So very impressed and satisfied.
Excellent service thanks
Tyres were delivered before the expected date. I had a mobile fitter come to my office to put the tyres on. All sorted quickly and for a reasonable price.
Great service from [REDACTED] but tyre fitting garage recommended expensive additional work that did not need doing. I confirmed this with an inspection from my regular qualified mechanic.
Brilliant prices with good choice of places to fit them. Good communication very pleased and will use again
Great service and great price 👍👍
Good price. And good service from the garage.
Very good service although there was a change of garages from the original choice
Good quality but let down by office efficiency!
"The service was excellent and quick, any problems were explained.Overall they were very helpful and polite, I would use again."
"I’ve used [REDACTED] for years now and I’ve always had a fantastic experience. The order process is quick and simple; the tyres are very competitively priced (often the cheapest available online); and the garage fitting experience is straightforward. Give it a go, I assure you you won’t be disappointed. A+++"
"Ordered easily, great price, delivered to a local fitter & fitted when stated. Fabulous!"
Ordered tyres and booked appoinment for fitting on the easy to use website. Tyres were fitted on my selected date with no issues whatsoever. Thanks for an extremely simple to use site and great prices as well.
Great service at the fitting bay. Pity [REDACTED] didn’t deliver the tyres when they said. 2nd time this has happened.
Excellent service from start to finish Will definitely use again
"I have already used this website twice for our family cars. Prices are competitive, there is a good variety of tyres of different prices. Tyres fitting is very quick and efficient. I am always very satisfied with the overall service!"
"Very efficient,, great service. Many thanks."
"Arrived at 9.40 for a 10 appointment... tyres didn’t arrive until 10:30 then I wait and waited until gone 12. A few Tyre fitters walking around eating, a couple busy"
No problems with [REDACTED] who supplied the tyre and cheaper than all other options; and an excellent service from the garage who fitted the tyre.
"I used [REDACTED] because they offered me a Saturday fitting slot. I could have booked with ats direct and saved £2 per tyre but couldn't book for the Saturday. Less than 24 hours (17) before my appointment I got an email off [REDACTED] to say it had been changed to Wednesday which wasn't what I wanted, if it was i would have booked it direct & saved myself money ."
Good value for money.
Great tyres at a great price but having booked a slot at 09:30 staff said it would be an hour. When I returned the wrong tyres I had ordered had been put on. I got an apology but it made me late for a meeting and initially was nae to feel I was in the wrong
Did exactly what it said on the tin!
Tyres arrived and were fitted as expected. No problem. I don't usually buy tyres online as I get first class service and prices from an independent fitting company where I live. However in this instance the only people who had my particular need in stock were the online companies. Michelin couldn't even quote a date for supply. Are the online brigade bullying the manufacturers into cutting the independents out I wonder?
Fab service!
"A very good experience. A very competitive price and decent choice of tyres. They have good communication also because my local garage couldn’t honour the initial time so an email came through with a contact number. I contacted it and within seconds, a lady took the call and liaised with the garage to sort it and agreed a new convenient time. Wouldn’t hesitate to use again and recommend."
Cheap and easy whats not to like
"Best price, best fitting service, what else could you ask for...?"
professional service throughout
"Owning a classic car tyres are sometimes not readily available,[REDACTED] delivered quickly and at a reasonable price."
Excellent service will definitely use again thanks
Guys are amazing tyres sorted and delivered in a few days. The finance options are a saving grace when your a little short on cash. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"Quick, easy and reliable."
I have used [REDACTED] on a number of occasions and have not been disappointed. Excellent service and competitive pricing.
"Had a problem with a tyre fitting shop . (They scratched the wheel !) [REDACTED] sorted it out ! for that alone I would give them 5 stars ! Plus the excellent service and keen pricing, can i give them six !"
"I have used them many times, always good service.."
"Fast and easy pain free process. Pick your tires, order your tires, pick the place you want to put them on and done."
"Excellent selection, great prices, easy to organise"
good helpful communication finding me a fitting garage on Isle of Man. Good price including delivery and fitting. Will definitely use again.
"Excellent service, will use again, highly recommend"
Great service and saved a lot on four new Goodyear tyres.Will use again as so handy to be able to get fitted so local to me.
Easy transaction. Good price and efficient hook-up with a local garage for fitting. Recommended.
"Given a date to get tyres changed which suited me, at a location that suited me and was rated well by others, tyres arrived on time from [REDACTED] and were fitted quickly and professionally by ATS Euromaster who in my opinion were also very good."
Quick easy and good value. Local fitting next day perfect.
"I certainly got 2 decent tyres for a better price than our local garage could offer. I was slightly miffed that, the following day after I ordered the tyres, [REDACTED] had a flash 10% on the same ones I'd bought! I was told they couldn't honour it in my case."
easy to use and great selection of tyres. Fitting available from various local traders and all priced well below the local dealer price
"Booked a week in advance, dropped car off on the day to be told by the garage the tyres hadn't arrived. I phoned [REDACTED] and after half an hour of back and forth calls I was told the tyres were out of stock. I ended up eventually getting a refund and then spent the rest of the day trying to find a garage that stocked the right size of tyres. So all in all I wouldn't say it was the easy way to buy tyres."
All worked perfectly.
Excellent service from all people contacted during the purchase and unfortunately the serious tyre fitting issue. This issue related to a supplier ATS in Dundee however it was dealt with by [REDACTED] staff
"Good website, great service on final fitted products but no reply in regards to email I sent to CS re. an out of stock Michelin line"
"Received a recommendation from a work colleague so went home and found the website. Looked at others but price and access to numerous garages decided it for me. Easy to order tyres, easy to choose a garage near me and had two front tyres fitted. Great service thanks"
Great service with tyres fitted at a great price. Would definitely buy my tyres from [REDACTED] again.
Competetive pricing quick delivery Fitted on time good service from garage fitting tyres Will use [REDACTED] again
Superb service
Simple and easy. Very good price
Very straightforwardMail order offers considerable saving
second lot of tyres from [REDACTED] found them most efficient will have no trouble in recommending them to my friends
Excellent experience and I will definitely use again the site was easy to use and painless from start to finish
Great value tires. Fitted and ready to go within about 25 mins. Great service.
Had a bit of trouble with the web site but computers aren't my thing.
Easy to use website that gave me the best offer. Local garage gave me excellent service.
"Easy to use, excellent prices and fitting service was brilliant."
"Even if you don’t know what you want the website is easy to use for choosing tyres and booking appointments. The partner garage was friendly, prompt and professional. Would recommend to anyone - and do."
"Easy to order, number of garages to have them fitted, and the one used was very quick and satisfactory."
Competitive price
Needed to change 3 Run Flats. [REDACTED] were 15% cheaper than the dealer quote and compared to some other companies online. Easy to browse and order. Size specifications are accurate when you choose make and model. Hassle free installation when you pick one of their premier partners. Couldn’t be easier!! Will definitely use again and recommend to friends and family!!But discounts given only when you order 4 tyres...
Exactly as ordered. Swift delivery to tyre fitters and most importantly no hassle!
Great service. Easy to use.
Efficient and great service
"Excellent product, service and price 👍"
"I have always received good service from Merityre, Abingdon in the past. This time was the same with the added bonus of [REDACTED] prices. Highly recommended."
Easy to search the tires I needed Great customer service Wouldn‚Äôt bother going anywhere else
Very good and cheap
"Sent the wrong tyres, the garage fitted them and I had tonspent an hour on hold trying to get it resolve"
"Fast delivery, however 2 incorrect tyres sent and fitted to the vehicle, should have been all V rated but sent 2 V and 2 H, the garage didn’t check and fitted them. This could have voided my insurance if I’d had an accident."
"great prices, super efficient service at the selected fitting venue"
Booked in for two tyres on my van turned up early and made very welcome left about 20mins later happy days why go anywhere else great job guys see you again
The original promise of two day delivery turned into four. But after that all went smoothly. Fitting at ATS very good. However getting Vredestien tyres for my other car were found available for £93.50 instead of £122 at [REDACTED]. So maybe a bit pricey.
Very good quick and reliable service
"Cheap, Fast and very friendly staff, what more can you want? I used the at home service, excellent."
Left the car to be done and got a call an hour later. Great job and no hassle.
Excelent service! Cheapest you can find!
All went to plan
Used these twice now. There was a problem with my first order which they rectified straight away. Great service.
Completing my order online was simple and easy. However a couple of hours after selecting my local garage and paying for my tyre i received an email saying that the garage I had chosen couldn't to the tyre on that day not even later on that week. I had to call and reschedule which put hassle back into something that was supposed to be hassle free. The different fitting garage were fantastic I would select them again.
Such a selection of tyres from economy to top rated tyres. Easy transaction and choice of local garages to use which you can book in there and then. All you need to do is turn up to your chosen garage and they have the tyres ready for you. No having to order or return another day.
A simple foolproof process from start to finish.A large selection of suitable tyres at good prices.
"We used ATS to replace our tyres, service was awful and when we arrived for an 8am appointment we were told they didn't open till 8.30. Wont use again"
An excellent and convenient service. Very easy to access and a very good range of tyres for all budgets. I would certainly use this service again.
Excellent price on quality tyres. Chosen tyre fitter (ATS) also offered polite and efficient service. Nothing to fault.
"Having bought a tyre for the first time from [REDACTED].com l can recommend them, top quality tyre at a competitive price and the fitting process was hassle free."
Easy to order and get it done will definitely recommend them
Easy to use great price and fitted at my local garage
The fitter was polite and quickly completed the task at hand.
"Easy to order, great service from our local fitter. Will definitely use again."
Great service.Easy to compare & choose tyres for my car. Couldn't find cheaper anywhere else (including fitting). Took the option to get them fitted by mobile fitter. Two tyres fitted & job done within 20 minutes. Will definitely use again.
User friendly website and great service.
Excellent service and quality of product is second to none
"Not a fault of [REDACTED] direct, but I think the tyre fitter damaged my alloy wheel. I have no way of proving it as I didnt take pictures beforehand, but I noticed it straight afterwards. Disappointed."
GREAT WAY TO BUY TYRES .EXCELLENT
"Great price, easy ordering"
Very easy to order on the website and subsequent work being done. Thank you
Easy and efficient way to buy tyres at a reasonable price
Great service at D P Motors
The service was perfect. The reason why I give only 4 stars that both of the tyres made in the last year.
We always use [REDACTED] for replacement tyres for our cars and the service is always first class.
Excellent tyre at an excellent price.Excellent service from Kipling auto centres as well
Tyres arrived as promised
"fitters didn't know much about AWD cars and tyre recommendations , which I thought was disappointing , gone back twice to have balancing redone ..still not perfect.."
"First time I have used the service . Have to say can't fault it , tyres were very good value and fitting service at chosen garage excellent . Would recommend anyone to try ."
Great tyres at a great price. The fitting centre picked up and fixed a puncture in another tyre. Great service.
"As usual I went for the better quality of tyres. This company offered the best price. Less than 23 hours after having the tyres fitted , one of them let me down. It turned out that there had been a problem when the tyre was fitted. As I was 80 miles from home I had to go to another tyre supplier who sorted me out. Once home I contacted [REDACTED] who immediately, no questions asked issued me a refund to pay for the 2nd tyre I had fitted.Mistakes happen, the proof of a really good company is how they react when things go wrong. In this case the response was first class and ensures that I will be using them for my future tyre supplies."
Great service. Fast. Superb tyres at a competitive price. Recent DOT
Bought the tyres I wanted online. Went to local garage I'd have used anyhow. Tyres fitted quickly. Job done. Brilliant.
"Excellent service. Got exactly what I wanted for a very competitive price. The garage that did my fitting were also very friendly and polite. Shame they couldn’t fill my new tires with nitrogen, but other than that I was thrilled with every aspect of my buying experience."
"Recomend, excellent service"
Simple efficient and inexpensive - what more can I say?
A1 v good excellent
There was a mix up with the delivery but it was sorted and the tyre was changed.
Excellent service and quality
Ordered online. Picked a date with tyre fitting local to meTyres fitted Job done
"Needed front tyres for my car, wanted run flats, contacted [REDACTED] and got them at a most reasonable price, they were delivered to the garage I had requested and a time for fitting them was sent to me. This is the first time I have used this company but it definitely won't be my last. Great service."
Simple and easy to use. No problems and great price
"Bought two rear run flat tyres for my BMW 5 series. Will use [REDACTED] from now on, and have recommended to my freinds."
Excellent service as usual 😁
"Everything should be this easy... Ordering, delivery, service. Thank you."
Tyres were priced competitive ordered and fitted within two days of purchase at a local tyre place of my choice really pleased with the prompt service
I had a issue with a delay of the fitting due a stock problem but I was notified in advance and the booking was rearranged for me. Everything ran smooth after that and i cannot fault the customer service and communication. I was given a good will gesture also which was a nice touch to a already good price. I will definatley use [REDACTED] again as issues somtimes arise and they dealt with it well in my case .
"Really good. A really good, simple way of buying really good tyres. Simple!"
Easy transaction for buying tyres online at a good price with the convenience of using a locally approved garage giving a great service to get them fitted.
This is an easy review for me simply Excellent order your tyres they will tell you when they will arrive and they do. Perfect
good priced tyres fitted as planned. staff polite
"Excellent service from start to finish. Had an issue that was dealt with quickly and professionally, would definitely recommend."
"Great way to buy the right tyres to suit your budget and preferences. Reviews and tyre descriptions make it easy to choose. Delighted with my new tyres (Michelin Primacy 4 at 10% discount), fitting partner was excellent and whole buying process so much better than the bad old days of turning up at a grubby tyre centre and hoping all will be ok!I recommend this company without reservation."
"Quick, reliable and friendly"
Excellent price for great quality tyres. Easy to use website.
"Great price, excellent service"
"The overall buying experience was good. Although the original tyres I bought were not in stock, I was given the option of a better spec tyre at no extra cost. The customer service team were helpful and apologetic. I would use [REDACTED] again."
Work was done to a very good standard and the service was very good.
Fantastic service from start to finish!
"Tyres were delivered promptly and on time to local fitter. Even though I'd made an error on the speed rating on the initial order which I didn't spot until I received the confirmation, the team at [REDACTED] were contactable quickly via email and on the telephone to help me resolve the issue and deliver the correct tyres on the scheduled day. Excellent service overall."
Totally happy with my purchase
"Ordering online was fast and simple. I chose the fit at home service for an extra £6 and it was worth every penny, the fitting was quick and efficient and the fitter polite and helpful. I can thoroughly recommend this service."
Best and easiest way to buy tyres for your car and at the right price!!
Great price and Daryl at Colwall MOT &Tyre Centre was very helpful
All went as per plan.
Quick delivery and good choice of appointments.Great communication and kept up to date prior to fitting.
Very easy to organise delivery and fitting great service
Great choice of tyres at varying price ranges to suit all pockets.Selecting a local garage was easy for them to be fitted.Would use again.
What ever tyre you want at great prices
Great tyre price. Close fitting location.Picked fitting location ATS extremely professional .
Quick efficient service. It went without a hitch.
Friendly and prompt service.Helpful. I would definitely use this branch again.
"Very good at What they do , very friendly and honest service :)"
"Great straightforward process from order to fitting, would happily recommend"
Needed 2 front tyres pretty quickly.for a m.o.t found [REDACTED].com who were very reasonably priced for really good tyres.easy to set up at on line and was done in less than 45min at local garage.would not hesitate to use them again.
Excellent tyres and great service would recommend with no problems
Excellent service.Tyres delivered on time to fitters and the appointment there was to my wish and the service there was first class.
"[REDACTED] were OK, but I make a bad choice by going to Cambridge Performance Tyres. Over-inflated both front tyres significantly, while their paperwork suggested they should have been correct. Also 'lost' one of my nice valve caps."
"Best price for branded tyres, fitted locally"
Great service thanks again
"Easy to use website with a wide range of tyres at great prices. Excellent service from [REDACTED] fitting centre in Tesco Silverburn, Glasgow"
"Great service, great tyres and a great price"
"Very quick service, easy to do and a really good rate."
Very easy to order online Great prices Fitted new tyres at a local garage Excellent service all round
Easy order friendly and helpful staff
From selecting my tyres to booking the fitting and driving home with new rubber; the process was simple and quick.Regular offers make it easy to find premium tyres at decent prices.
Can't beat [REDACTED] for on price & local fitting service.
went like clockwork
"Easy to book in the tyre replacement, the garage were aware of the booking (although they did mention that not all the details get passed through from [REDACTED] hence they collected similar information), they did the work in the timeframe they advised and all is good"
"Competitive, easy to use and reliable."
Whole process from ordering to arranging fitting was easy. I saved £80 compared to kwik-fit etc .
"First time that I've used [REDACTED]. First impression, excellent, the ordering process is very easy, and so is booking an appointment locally. Will use again because the price you can save a great selection for the car."
"Excellent cost effective system, very easy to follow and service at tyre centre was equally as good."
"great price,works well with local ats. highly recommended."
"I was able to purchase high quality tyres saving about £60.00 compared with other tyre dealers. They were paid for online, and I could choose a time to suit me for the fitting. The garage staff were very friendly and helpful."
Simple easy process from start to finish
get best price on the market for my tyres. excellent service on changing tyres.
Good price for tyres easy fitting would recommend to family and friends will be using in the future again
"I would have given five stars, but the tyres hadn't been delivered to the fitting station for the allotted time slot (they arrived three days later). The helpdesk was very helpful & polite though.However, in regard of value for money (nevermind the ease of choosing and booking on line and not having to buy from the limited range of my local tyre 'specialists') the other four stars are well deserved. I will be using [REDACTED] again this autumn for my winter tyres, when hopefully it'll be able to award the full five stars."
Very good price on 4 Michelin pilot sport. 4. Quick and easy to arrange. Have used befor and will use again.
Prompt and pleasant service. Tyres arrived and were fitted at my house at 8 am.
"I've used [REDACTED] a number of times, now, for my wife's car as well as my own. They provide a great range of tyre, quite spoilt for choice, and they're delivered at the exact day required. Recommended"
Good deal on tyres you want at a choice of fitting stations near you
Great price for good tyres thanks
Great prices and exceptional fitting service
As the title says. Can’t fault buying tyres this way. Replaced with Audi factory fit premium tyres for the same price that the dealership would fit budget tyres.
Great value and great service from ATS Godalming
Great service at great prices
"Ordered what I needed spot on . Ordered what I needed ..... booked time slot to have the tyres fitted. I turned up was seen straight away and 30 minutes later I drove away with the tyres fitted. Very straight forward, great service"
It’s not the first time that I use [REDACTED] services and I’m very happy with it. Never had a problem and it’s always a Very quick service and with quality. I do recommend this company :)
"Even after I ordered the wrong size tyres, changing was easy. Fitted at the nearest garage in the scheme. pretty easy to organise."
"Good service,tyre arrived early and fitted same day.Good price. Will you again"
Excellent!!
I AM HAPPY WITH THE PRICE I PAID. THEY FITTED THE TYRE AT THE CORECT TIME. WIL USE THEM AGAIN FOR SURE.
Convenient location plus good price. Garage staff very helpful.
Excellent service. Couldn’t be happier
"Good price, good service. Well done."
"Very good experience, would definitely recommend and use the service again."
Based on Woodley autos fitting the tyres
As always very happy with [REDACTED] !!!Simply the best ! Andreas
"It was my first time buying online tyres, but I have to admit that this online shop surprised me in good way with the prices and the customer service. Truly recommend them."
Got tyres.............
I ordered my tyres on a Monday evening to be fitted on Wednesday only to get told they couldn’t do it. Speaking to the local garage he said they were never going to be fitted for the day I had booked for! It was then booked for the following Monday only to be cancelled again! Only an email to the ceo sorted it out to be fitted on the Monday! Will be using tyres on the drive from now on!
"I found the staff at BC.com very polite and helpful and BC themselves were/are one of the cheapest online tyre suppliers. My gripe though concerns the fact that having ordered and paid online for 5 tyres for my Land-rover, when the day came for them to be fitted I had rung up the previous afternoon to be told they didn’t have the tyres so the fitting wouldn’t take place. As it was a home fitting I’d taken the day off!!!!I was then told they could get four of the tyres for me by the following Tuesday and the fifth by the Friday. Great thought I.Well, I got my four tyres fitted on the Tuesday. No problem.Thursday afternoon came at at about 5.30pm I got an email from BC stating they couldn’t get my 5th tyre and “how did I want to proceed”.Livid???? Just a tad.I called BC but by then they’d closed for the day, so rang first thing the next day. Very helpful and polite lady understood my frustrations but went on to tell me that the tyre I’d ordered, paid for and expected to be fitted that morning couldn’t be obtained and BC didn’t know when they’d get some in. Great!!!Bottom line is a tyre was sourced (in Spain), and was eventually fitted the following Wednesday. Three weeks this took to complete.My advice would be make sure BC either have or can immediately source the tyres you’ after before committing to the deal."
"Great system, makes things dead easy as I have a BMW with run flats"
Good tyre choice at a fair price.
"Arrived at garage to be informed that you had sent one correct tyre long with no incorrectly sized tyre, the problem was further exaggerated by [REDACTED] making a other appointment without consultation with me for 4 days later when I was due to be away. I therefore had to cancel the transaction and try to locate tyres elsewhere through my local garage they did mange his with lot of phone calls. The one positive was that the tyres eventually procured were in fact cheaper than through [REDACTED], so if anyone is reading this please ring around your local dealers before committing yourself."
Quick to get fitted and saved money even tho same garage fitted them
"Used them lots of times. I guess the fitting location and time of day makes a difference. If busy you may have to plan going somewhere whilst the tyres are fitted but I choose mid week. So far, very good prices and plenty of reminders about the appointment."
"Discount CodesI had a previous bad experience with [REDACTED] fitting service via ATS. BC gave me a discount code for use on a future order. However when I came to order my next tyres there was a promotion for buying two tyres which I was able to take advantage of. However, the BC system is unable to process two discount codes therefore making my previous discount useless.ATS Aylesford still needed over an hour to fit two tyres I will not use them again."
Really good and efficient service. My Honda dealer said that the price I was paying per tyre at [REDACTED] was less than they could buy them in for. Highly recommended. Thanks
"Excellent. The Web site works really well, good communication throughout the transaction.. Local garages used. I don't think I would use any ware else again! Very pleased."
After contacting [REDACTED] an appointment was made with a local garage for four new tyres to be fitted the following day. Garage reception was polite and courteous. Tyres were fitted within 45 minutes of arrival. Altogether an excellent experience.
Good service in a timely way
"Very good service, thank you."
"My first appointment was declined by the garage on the date I picked but fortunately [REDACTED] sorted me another appointment at 3 days notice with a different garage, can't fault them👍"
It was nice and easy to navigate the site with a good variety of tyres and garages available. Very pleased.
A very easy ordering process good competitive prices and a good selection of fitting centres. Very happy yet again.
"Plenty of tyres to choose from, very convenient and you can pick a time & date that suits you to get them fitted. They saved me a lot of money which is always nice."
"Great tyres, great price, great service"
"Quick, easy and simple process. Cheaper than going to fitting centres direct."
"Very simple process. Tyres delivered to a local garage fitting service, convenient to my location."
Very good reliable service and good prices.
amazing service thanks
"Great tyres at a good price....The service given by the ATS in Gloucester was adequate. They tried to change our fitting time on arrival, but eventually honoured our agreed time slot."
"Well it all started out very well, went downhill, but then was recovered in the end"
Same as last time I reviewed this same purchase
"Always buy my tyres from [REDACTED] now, easy experience and saves £££££s"
"Fantastic service, excellent website and great prices! Will definitely use [REDACTED] again!"
"Excellent service. Value for money. To top it all, Total Tyre Company, Woodley installers were very good and fast at their job. Very professional."
Quick cost effective service highly reccomend
"[REDACTED] as a company was very good to deal with, especially when I got the order wrong.However, they need to be more selective with their fitting partners. Both my wheels had paint gouged off when removing and re fitting new tyres. Poor equipment and badly maintained."
"Tyres were/are very good, and much quieter than the ones i took off (then again they were illegal!). Garage was excellent, and very prompt. I would use again without hesitation."
All good. Excellent prices.
2 really friendly/ professional lads fitted Avon ZZ5’s to front wheels of car. They were really careful not to damage the (as yet unscathed) alloy wheels. Tyres feel much much better than the (frankly) awful Pirelli P Zeros that were on the car from new and were scrubbed after only 7500 miles.....even when new they felt skittish in the wet esp. the new Avon’s are quieter and offer way more grip (too early to discuss wear). Will definitely be back to these guys to get my 2 rears replaced when required.
easy to arrangeno problem with fitter
Really straight forward and easy to understand. First time I ever bought tyres online and it was really clear how to do it! Good recommendations for garages too
Excellent experience
The website is very easy to navigate. The whole purchasing process is simple and uncomplicated with great choice and a variety of prices. Choosing a fitting service and time close to your postcode is so simple. This is the second time I have used [REDACTED] and would certainly recommend them.
Hassle free tyre purchasing
"Excellent service, fantastic prices & extremely fast delivery. I will definitely use [REDACTED] again."
"good value, good choice of garages."
Loved the flexibility of the service and everything worked perfectly
Excellent service from order to fitment
Good price. Fitting garage was excellent. Everything promised was delivered.
"Best way I've found to buy tyres. Plenty of info available, good prices and very convenient."
"Tyres at a good price but its the option to have them fitted at home that makes all the difference, leave [REDACTED] to it and get on with your day."
Price ease of use
"It was like clockwork & easy to set up, in addition it was more than 20% cheaper for the same brand obtained elsewhere."
Excellent service and price. Have been buying from [REDACTED].com a good few years now. Highly recommended.
"Excellent service, really friendly."
"bought tyres that were brand new product , reasonably priced & tyre fitter was local ."
Tyres delivered and fitted on time.. very good system and service... will use again.
Excellent service. 2nd time to use [REDACTED]. but this time I had to amend the time which I was assisted with and when choosing the premier garages. they do the job well and lined my boot as they put my old tyre in. thank you [REDACTED]
"Really competitive prices, quick, no fuss service, and really lovely helpful blokes. Can't praise highly enough, and I wouldn't go anywhere else."
Delivery got delayed twice but only notified me on the day meaning I had to change plans multiple times. Otherwise fair service. I will shop around next time.
I found the whole experience quick and easy and the tyres were delivered to a garage close by also the garage were so professional and quick I was out with in under 30 min and with two kids in toe it helped.
Cheaper than the shop but the wheel balancing never gets done
"Good price (nearly the lowest). Many local places to choose for fitting. Sensible web-site, clear confirmation emails - so pretty efficient process."
It was good to be able to use a local garage within easy walking distance from home. the whole process was trouble free.
Quick and decent price
"No hassle , great price and excellent service. Couldn't fault in anyway. Fast delivery and only took 40 mins to change 2 tyres. Would highly recommend."
"Perfect. Very good price on tyres, inc fitting and old ones cleared too.This particular garage/tyre centre were brilliant. Nice and calm, no panic or danger and polite guys. Took extra care with vehicle being a classic ref jacking points and wheel nug torque. Couldn't be happier."
Ordered tyres online and booked an appointment locally. It was smooth transaction. Recommended.
Tyres never arrived so had to be re ordered so a waste of a Saturday morning
"Excellent service very easy to use, will cert use next time."
Very competitive price for my Michelin CrossClimate tyres. Fitting by Angle Park Garage done without a hitch and with good humour!
booked wed job don friday
Ordered my tyres then they said they could not get them so I had to take another make and change my fitting date.
lowest cost easy to arrange fitting through website
Booked an appointment for a tyre fitting only to be told later it wasn’t possible to do it then. Slow response to emails. Then told that I may be charged to cancel my order! Unacceptable service.
Very pleased.Good service and fast.I recommended to anyone! !!
Fitted promptly
Good service and price. ‚ÄòFaceless‚Äô company
Easy to do business with
"I already contacted [REDACTED] privately regarding a poor experience, but having received 6 E-mails asking me for feedback, they are clearly desperate for me to publicly review them. So here is the message I sent: ""Not a great experience today. I had my Passat booked in for a new pair of rear tyres at 8am at Tesco Bar Hill. I arrived at 7:55 as your instructions say. Your technician showed up at 8:10 with no apology or explanation. I gave him my keys, he said it would take around half an hour. 20 minutes later at 8:30 he phoned me to say he couldn’t find my locking nut, I explained where it was (in the tyre-change kit…not a particularly obtuse place for it to be located?), he still couldn’t find it. I went back to the car to show him where it was, he stated that he didn’t have time to rummage through people’s stuff. I submit that if he’d shown up on time he’d have had an extra 10-15 minutes to rummage through my stuff. He was finished at 9am, so the whole process took over an hour.I received the reminder text of my appointment at 9:37am, having already returned home!"".There you go [REDACTED], are you happy you bombarded me with requests to be reviewed now?"
I have used this garage on multiple occasions. The promptness and level of service are second to none. Thoroughly recommended.
"I booked an available appointment from the options provided, which was then unilaterally rebooked for an inconvenient time. By the time I was able to talk to someone at [REDACTED], it was too late to rebook for the day I needed. I had to cancel the appointment and find a different source of tyres at short notice."
Booked a tyre fitting 48 hours in advance - next day the booking got cancelled / delayed by 72 hours which meant car would not ready for family trip over the weekend and too late to arrange an alternative fitter. Pretty poor service
"Very easy & straight forward, would definitely recommend."
good value and prompt service
Fast and efficient. Pleasure doing business .
"Good price and service, this is my 4th time using [REDACTED] and will be back."
The only place to buy tyres !!
"No-nonsense website and often have special offers that make them even better value for money. In my area I get a choice of good quality garage or moble fitting centres unlike some where you have no options but to go for a 'National' option. Used them twice for complete sets of tyres, fitted by ATS ( who have very clean and tidy workshops I would add )."
Good quality tyres good service at fitting garage excellent value.
"I bought Michelin pilot sport with ✌️20% more range 275/35/19 and the tires are with 0,29m grip for a 5000 miles. Minicab driver not a race.... and they always delivered more than half year old tires. Now will test my new Goodyear asymmetric 3 from them but definitely not gonna bye anything else from thereHow can I add video from Mercedes Bromley about my tires Michelin pilot sport??? Thanks"
Good quality service with a smile. Would definitely be back and recommend to others
I have used [REDACTED] for about 3 years now and have never had any problem.Tyres are cheap and fitting is easy.just don’t fall for the tracking is out at the garage.
Best price. Good communication throughout. Very pleased.
Excellent picked the garage I wanted with time convenient to me. Toyo tyres which was better and cheaper than any garage could quote.
Great service. From the supply of tyres right the way through to the fitting. No issues and a great price. Will be back again👍🏽
"Vast tyre choices, competitive prices, great service all round."
Very good price and excellent service from both members of staff
"Excellent,good prices,everything went without a hitch,from ordering through to fitting.what more can I say."
"Quick and easy to use, some confusion at fitting centre bit easily sorted"
"Very good. Only thing, they forgot to write the mileage on the paperwork, which is important."
All worked well.
"Couldn’t really fault them, staff were courteous and polite. The only possible downside if I’m being hyper-critical is the customer waiting area at the branch I had my tyres renewed wasn’t exactly The Savoy (not that you expect luxury, but you get the idea) and there was no viewing window to the bay to watch them working on your car. As an engineer myself, I like to view these things going on."
"Have used [REDACTED], a few times for tyres, they are hard to beat. However I have found if you are booking other services, it’s not as seamless as tyre bookings. My car needed a service and MOT, the garage didn’t get the instruction through in enough time, so my service and mot were a week apart. You have a good set up it just needs a bit of refinement where other services are required besides tyres"
Very good quality service will use them again
"Decently priced tyres, good value for money, fitted quickly and promptly."
"As with all our [REDACTED] purchases, it was seamless and good value for money. For the last five years, we have not gone anywhere else to buy tyres for our family."
"hi i received an emaIL FROM YOURSELVES STATING I HAVE BEEN REFUNDED, IT IS NOW 2 MONTHS AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY MONEY BACK,THE TYRES YOU SENT WERE WRONG SO PLEASE CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS OR I WILL TAKE IT FURTHER !!!!!!!!!!!"
Great experience and the garage was great.
All good! I’m very happy!
Great service! Easy to find tyres online with comparative pricing. I was able to have my tyre fitted at home and the fitter was very friendly and helpful.
"Branded tyres, keen price, good service"
An amazing website and very easy to use. Have used them for the last few years and have always been impressed with the ease of use. Even better I saved quite a bit on my tyres. Very informative on what to go for and plenty of options. Thank you.
"Initially ordered Tyre , then was told it was unavailable. Only later to see it on website at a higher price. Rang and complained and they price matched. Lost initial fitting date."
"I use [REDACTED].com first time with fitting and I'm realy supprise how the all procedure go. Everything what you need to do is a making order, select your service, set up appointment and arriving. I recomend this site."
"Fitted at Celtic tyres, with fast delivery. No complaints, they were flexible on fitting times and it was possible to fit them a day earlier than scheduled.Tyres are pretty decent for the price too"
Great service and top garage
Good prices and an excellent service
"Good price, good website, competent mechanics to fit"
Everything was level
"Good price , local fitter provided good service, returning customer so proven retailer"
"Top price,top quality serviceThank youJim Fleet"
Fast turnaround
Every time I use [REDACTED] it is always cheaper than buying tyres from other retailers and fitted when booked
"First time using [REDACTED], very easy to order and tyres were fitted locally to me 2 days later. Cannot fault the service at all and will certainly be using it again, cannot believe I have left it this long to use them!"
"The website is easy to navigate.The range of tyres is good.The features of each tyre is good to know, and assists choice.The tyre are good value for money all around, and the discounts on some can assist choice.The garage I use is always ready for the care, and time slots adhered to.I never look anywhere else for tyre now - [REDACTED] is my 'go to'."
arrived at the time and with in 30 mins the job was done superb
Was very simple process ordering online. Choosing a day and time that suited me and also a place I wanted to go too. Would order from them again
"Easy to book, excellent service when I needed to alter my appointment at the garage at short notice. Would definitely use again."
Very good price and amazing service. Will definitely use again
Had an issue with the fitting centre damaging one of my alloys. [REDACTED] customer care team dealt with this courteously and professionally.Excellent service by Ellie Wood and Katrina Kelly at the customer care team. Thank you.
"Quick service, competitive prices"
Simple and easy way of getting tyres. Great price and service is spot on
Friendly fast service.
"Service by [REDACTED] is straightforward, and excellent. Their partner garage was wonderful. I will use this service again and recommend to friends and family. Thank you Bc."
"well satisfied with the service, had two new tyres fitted to the front and all seemed ok. The only problem was when I travelled on a dual carriageway, three days later, at 70mph my cars warning system lit up and informed me to check my tyre pressures. I checked them and there was a difference of 3 psi between the fitted tyres, thought I must have a slow puncture but since inflation I have checked and all seems ok."
"Good service,started job right on my appointment time."
Choosing and getting new tyres fitted has never been so easy.
Top class service along with the best price I could find.Will use again
Great service- exactly as promised
Very good service from[REDACTED] and also east Bilney garage highly recommend them.
"Wrong tyres showed up, so couldn’t be fitted. Was offered a £40 refund for inconvenience which I accepted but still hasn’t been credited to my account. Filled out customer service questionnaire and requested call back. Still haven’t received a call back! Not impressed with the customer service at all. I shan’t be using again tyres are just a good value from my local garage"
Good product as specified.
Good service 👌🏼
The price was OK the fitters were great no issues great guys but [REDACTED] failed to deliver the same tires and instead sent two different ones it then took a further 4 days and two trips to the garage and they thought 10% off my next order was an OK compensation I would say that plus a 10% refund for wasted time and petrolTires are great much quieter on the road
"Great price, easy to use, will definitely use again."
Wheels not balanced properly am taking car back this morning.
Easy to order and good value.
"We have now used [REDACTED] twice, both times it was so easy and cheaper than elsewhere. We even found a very local garage on the website to do the work. Will definitely use again when the time comes."
Very good service and great price range of tyres.Very helpful staff and everything went as planned.Will use them again.
Unfortunately rated only as 3 star as they failed to deliver my tyres to the garage on time meaning I wasted time going twice. Shame as previously been great service
"Really good ordering process, few issues with dates and resolved wrong size ordering so very happy overall."
"Very easy and efficient, will recommend to all I speak to."
Very good service and would use them again
"A simple online process, great value tyres and straightforward way of choosing the local garage. Will use again!"
The website was so easy to use and I managed to find a local garage to fit a new tyre for a very competitive price. I was very relieved as other tyre companies couldn’t even find a tyre to fit as the car was a 2019 number plate . When they did I had to wait a week for a tyre to be delivered! Not good when you have only 3 useable tyres . The garage I went to next day were friendly and really good. The receptionist was so welcoming and even made me a cup of tea while I waited. Will definitely use them again and [REDACTED]
"[REDACTED], i cannot fault. My only issue is with the fitting garage. Why they cannot put the correct tyre pressures when fitting my new tyres, they put them 4psi too low. This is 10% lower they are supposed to be set at. Is this not a safety issue. The info is shown on the fuel flap, it's not difficult. Or they should have asked me the question. They are supposed to be the experts not me."
"Extremely impressed with the tyre quality, price was unbeatable and fitted for free at a garage near by. Beats commercial mainstreet tyre outlets that try to find half a dozen other things that need doing when you havent even asked them! Have used [REDACTED] before and woulnt even bother with anyone else. Highly recommended."
I bought my tyres individually due to cost but the second tyre that arrived tooled to have been fitted before I got it it had the soap on the rim of tyre and looked scuffed round the edge I’ve just took it now to be fitted and the fitted said the same but as a service the service was easy fast delivery and cheaper than the rest Cheers
As a returning customer once again a very professional and profitable purchase . A1 service as usual
We have used [REDACTED] for tyres over the last few years and have no complaints. Service is defo 5 ⭐️. 😁
Very pleased with the service with [REDACTED] also very happy with the price of our tyres and none but least the guy at the service point were ever so helpful and pleasant well done guy will have no hesitation to use you again one happy customer thanks again
Good work and my car was washed and hovered out when I picked it up.
very much satisfied
Great service. Found everything i needed at the right price.
"The only problem I had which was new to me was the tyre fit. I'm not sure it was prominent enough on the website and I'm not sure what difference it makes (other than price) but I originally ordered a Mercedes fit tyre for my Jag and I had to re-order and wait some time. It might be advisable if a check could be made for a car make & tyre match where ""fit"" is important."
"Everything went well with no glitches, thank you"
Have used [REDACTED] in the past with no problems ....However this time my tyres were delayed by a week from promised fitting date.This meant that I had to reschedule appointments arrange lifts - causing unnecessary extra organisation.Probably will not use them again !
I have used [REDACTED] to put tyres on my car on two occasions now and I have found the process to be efficient and most importantly it saves you money. Sames tyres - cheaper price!
Excellent efficient service
My fourth time with [REDACTED] and I have no hesitation in recommending them. Ease of use of site to order and fund fitting centre to suit YOU. Good prices; cheaper than anything else I have found by some way.
"Just a great way to buy tyres. Ordered 2 Avon’s last year, got a split in the sidewall so check the website to find they were still available at the same price.Used a great local garage who have a collection of classic magazines while you wait. Perfect"
"Very good. Only negative was I had a date booked and they had to delay due to not having the tyre in Stock, so had to go on spare for a week and a half."
Great price and very good service
"Failed to supply tyres, when asked for a refund I was told I had to wait..."
"2x Bridgestone Potenza S001 285/30R19 Merc OnlyPROS:1) (easily) Best fitted price available anywhere2) Fitted at a local trader I know3) Customer Service was excellent in fixing a problem with the orderCONS:NONE!I bought 2 pretty expensive tyres for my Merc CLS. I’d had Bridgestones on my summer wheels for over 40,000 miles on the rears. I’ve been running Winter Wheels and tyres and when I had to get my summer wheels back on and the rears replaced, I tried [REDACTED] (BC). Having bought tyres online for the last 3 sets of tyres, I found BC to be the cheapest available for what is quite an unusual size. Add to this there was a 10% off flash sale that day and the price was considerably cheaper than TyreLeader. The wheels and tyres were fitted by a local tyre dealer I know. Unfortunately when I got home, I realised that one of the tyres was not a Mercedes Only(MO) tyre. The difference between the standard tyre and the MO is that the MO tyre has a significant 2cm flange that protects my lovely AMG 19in rims. I often say that you only know what a company is like until there is a problem. The resolution of the problem is the mark of how good the company is. BC went above and beyond:I contacted BC and they were fantastic. As I work in London, and I’m busy at the moment, it took me a little while to get round to taking photos for BC’s reference. However, despite having travelled over 700 miles since fitting, BC have arranged for the tyre to be replaced with the correct one. Additionally, BC gave me a generous goodwill gesture as recognition of my inconvenience. I will not only buy all my future tyres from them, but I will also highly recommend them to my family and friends. If all companies treated their customers with the efficiency, courtesy and genuine desire to provide a good service, as BC do, the world would be a better place! Well done [REDACTED] and thank you."
Fantastic service and prices....have used them before..... excellent service......no need to go anywhere else.
Top service 👍
"Tyres were late, fitting had to be rescheduled."
"My first experience was great really straight forward fitter was really friendly, I did not hesitate to go back for my next purchase, unfortunately the fitter I had used before was busy so I chose another local one all seemed great.Then I get an email informing me my chosen fitter is unable to accomodate my tyre size, fine but if so they really should remove them as an option when you buy that size tyre.I was offered another fitter further away probably the only one available that day but I did not wish to drive too far with a tyre that could deflate at any time, I tried to decline the suggestion but this was ignored and the booking made, I did not have the time whilst working to be messed about I gave up and requested a refund.I had time off the following week so I decided to try once more to get the tyres sorted only to be misled by the search engine metadata and my own eagerness for a bargain, I was in too much of a hurry and thought I had finally found a real bargain, I did not check properly and I bought a smaller size 18 inch instead of 19 inch.I noticed as soon as I got the confirmation email and sent an email requesting the size change and to cancel the fitting date. obviously I would have to pay the difference.An email arrived confirming the fitting time so I sent another email requesting contact, 5 hours later I got another email (this is quick but seems like forever when you need something sorting)the email informed me I wanted to change the tyres I had already bought to the same ones really? why on earth would anyone want that? again they are not reading emails, I responded correcting the mistake.The following day I had heard nothing regarding the change and the appointment was due that day, I then received a text informing me my appointment was due in 30 minutes.I sent another email asking for urgent contact.Hours later still nothing.I then spent around ten minutes on hold only to be politely informed that someone would phone me back in a few hours.They did as promised phone me back and finally I got a person who listened, I explained my mistake she quickly sorted it explained the extra cost and booked the day and time for me.The fitter Mckinnon Motors was great again really quick and courteous.It is such a shame a hassle free way of getting a good deal on tyres is marred by poor communication skills.When it works it really works, when something goes wrong it can be a challenge."
Absolutely excellent service. Noticed I'd ordered the wrong tyre for my car and emailed me straight away. Was easily rectified by phone. Garage faultless. Highly recommend
Friendly and helpful staff
From doubtful beginning process couldn’t be easier
"easy, no hassle service. keep up the good service guys :-)"
Excellent service. Very quick and easy
good prices worked out well
Superb efficient service.
Very pleased with the service received. Efficient and courteous and helpful to my husband who is disabled. Would certainly use them again.
The website is informative and easy to use. My chosen tyre fitters texted me to confirm the appointment and were ready when I arrived. The job was done quickly and efficiently. I have no complaints.
It was so easy to order the tyres and arrange fitting of them
Overall good service. Had to contact as didn’t recieve confirmation on tyre booking but dealt with promptly and well when phoned up customer service team
Very quick and easy and good value for money. Very friendly
A great help made the procedure very simple & I recieved a great deal
I drove into a screwdriver which lodged itself on my back tyre. It caused slow but certain deflation. I needed a fast and reliable service at a convenient to replace the tyre. I used [REDACTED].com services and I was pleased with the overall service.
Brilliant no hassle and no hidden extras!
"Easy on line booking, great customer service on the day, quality work completed during the given time slot, no hanging about."
Up to now my experience had been excellent. However my recent experience of customer service was poor. I ordered tyres on Friday and although the Monday was a bank holiday I expected the tyres to be fitted on Tuesday am which I had been told would be the earliest which was fine. However Tuesday came and I had not received a fitting slot. I phoned the garage and they agreed to fit them as long as I could get there b4 9.30.I did and the job was done by 11.15.The garage came good.
What a fantastic service I would recommend this service to all it was so easy The garage that I went to was superb they were so helpful and nothing was too much trouble Having just moved to the area it was so refreshing to receive such a high level of customer care
Very helpful and friendly- will using and recommending these guys
"Service works mainly as expected. For any extras like TPMS valves, price is fixed by the fitter and not known until tyres are being fitted.Price could better. I probably suffer because Michelin own [REDACTED] and I always buy Michelins!"
Quick and easy service and the garage they recommended was fantastic!
So far great value tyres. Will be buying again
"The tyres were fitted at one of your centres (Bathwick Tyres, Weymouth, Dorset), where we were treated with indifference, as though we were being nuisances for being there. We did not receive an invoice, the valve dust caps were not refitted after the new tyres had been fitted. Shockingly, the workmanship was downright dangerous as the wheel nuts on both wheels had not been tightened, I was able to remove them with my fingers after checking for a clonking noise from the front of the car which turned out to be caused by the wheels moving on the studs due to the wheel nuts coming undone."
Cant fault [REDACTED] but pick you fitter carefully as Jeffreys tyres in Warrington who I picked were poor. I booked an Am appointment via the [REDACTED] sit and duly turned up around 9 am to be told they couldn't even look at it until 12 and was asked to leave my car with them. I said i booked Am and was told they dont do appointments. Do i sail i will return at 12 and was again told they dont do appointments. Their fitting bay at this point had 1 car in and nobody waiting and their own website takes appointments. Ive used them for 20 years but never again. I will book through BC though and choose another fitter
"I was advised to arrive at garage early on a first come first serve basis. I arrived at 8am. Unfortunately this was not the case on arrival as garage advised that my time schedule was 9.30, so had to hang around for 2 hours ☹️. Mixed instruction which could have been clearer 🤔"
Price was great and very convinient having a time slot but the service was poor. There was debate over whether it could be done because there was a small amount of snow on the ground and they were having a problem getting cars on the ramp. This station is located in a petrol station so no shortage of grit etc so seemed a bit silly that they were making such a fuss. They were also very slow and swore a lot whilst doing the work which seemed unnecessary!
First class service and price.
"First appointment was cancelled as weren‚Äôt delivered in time. Second appointment, I waited and hour before they told me only one tyre had been delivered. Had to be away from the office for a third day to finally get the other tyre fitted. Would not recommend."
Good price and all went smoothly
"Friendly, professional service. Appointment time met and the staff were 👍"
recommended good company
Excellent price and customer service. Would recommend to anyone who wants a new tyre.
"excellent, courteous service. highly reccomended."
Helpful and fast service. The guys there were helpful and knowledgeable. My service was fast and efficient. Will definitely be returning and would recommend üëçüèº
"We always use [REDACTED] for our Tyres, excellent price & service, we wouldn't go anywhere else."
Terrific idea & execution!
"Was really impressed with how easy it was to deal with [REDACTED], the hardest part was having to go outside in the cold to find my tyre size. Picked the tyers I wanted and a time that suited and now I have new tyers. Easy as that. Will definitely use again. Thanks"
Spot on great service and excellent value.
"I would be happy to recommend [REDACTED].com to purchase tyres. I'm far less happy with the garage they sent me to, to have the tyres fitted. I asked this garage to perform an oil change at the same time which they did. However over 400 miles later the electronics in my car are still telling me I need an oil change. So 5 stars for [REDACTED] and only 2 stars for their chosen garage. 😕"
Very quick and quality service
This is a genuine review. I have used BC a number of times and have never been let down. Best prices and local fitters.
Excellent experience. Used [REDACTED] twice and have had no problems. Very reasonable price options and discounts
Great service as alwaysAlways use [REDACTED] for my tyres and have never let me down. Great prices and excellent tyre range.
Very good service.Highly recommended!
Good efficient service.
"Good tyres at a competative price, you choose the fitter at a time suitable for yourself."
Good price - The fitting took place when planned and the staff were both helpful and courteous so what's not to like!
"Always competitively priced, always deliver on time and this occasion price matched when the ones I ordered were out of stock! Superb."
Good serviceCompetitive prices
All went smoothly. Fitted by ATS Pensby who didn't try to push any extras to the order. Full marks to them for that.
"Easy on line ordering; good communication, good service from start to finish. Well satisfied."
"Great price, great tyres & great garage"
Easy to order came on time there preferred fitters very friendly and help full .
"Excellent service,So easy to buy and arrange fitting that was convenient to me,Excellent price."
very efficient
"This is not a review of [REDACTED].com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them (A&S MOT Ltd).A terrible experience meaning I will never use A&S MOT Ltd again. Details of the issues are below.- Arranged and paid for two new tyres to be fitted and 4-wheel alignment as rear tyres wearing on inside- Took time off work and waited at garage. Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told ""all done"" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety."
"I love [REDACTED] and would not use anyone else for my tyres. Great tyres, great prices"
For several years I have been buying my tyres online to ensure I get the best tyres for my cars at a good price. This is my first time buying from [REDACTED] - but annoyingly the day AFTER I bought these tyres [REDACTED] had a special 25% discount on the Michelin tyres I had just bought! How annoying.
No hassle service.
Easy website to use. Booking system straightforward and fitting on the day was nice and easy.
Excellent Premium economy tyres are excellent
"Good vaue for money, and a convienient way to have new tyres."
Great tyres at fantastic prices
At least the second time I have used [REDACTED]. I like the choices and the amount of information available to decide. Prices seem fair. No hesitation in recommending them.
"Great service, turned up when expected replaced tyre efficiently thanks"
Good service came at the time stated to the address I asked and a decent price.
"Always check here first to get an idea for price. Made better this time by 10% discount due to a mishap in the booking system last time. Took to a garage I knew this time and great service, never had problems other than once and used quite a few times."
Very friendly staff and quick response
"Highly Recommended. Ordering process and delivery to chosen fitter is flawless. Price of tyre was very competitive. The fitter, KNM Motors of Morley, West Yorkshire, chosen from the [REDACTED] list was outstanding. Very happy all round."
Easy and the fitter was great
I found [REDACTED] the cheapest for quality tyres in my area.The service was easy to use and everything went like clockwork.
"Excellent price, excellent service."
"Excellent. Ordered a new tire, fitted. Went to the local garage, they did it. £56. Bam."
the friendly way the representative of the company dealt with the job. Therefore making the experience hassle free.
Why pay full price when you can go on [REDACTED] and choose same tyres at garage of your choice and pay less. Order online then receive an email for your fitting appointment. Easy
"Quick, easy and the guy's fitting the tyres were superb. no chips in the alloy wheels and balanced perfectly."
Good web site. Good prices. Good to be able to book a precise fitting time. Smooth and seamless every time.
"From veiwing to ordering to fitting, plus being kept up to date with the order, what more could you want ? Yup great price as well thanks."
Great prices and service...easy to book.
"I found the ordering easy, having them fitted was just as good. I have used this service before, and I will use it in the future"
"Used before, and again good service and good price.Cant see any reason not to use you in the future.......but hopefully not too soon😁😁"
"good quality, friendly service at really good price"
Great price and easy transaction
Excellent and quick service !!
Excellent service from start to finish. Would highly recommend.
"Great price and fast, reliable fitting process."
"Very easy to order online, and the local fitter is always courteous and polite."
Good choice of tyres at fair prices. It's also convenient to have a choice of where and when to have the tyres fitted.
Very happy and easy to order and cheaper than the competitors.
Does what it says on the label. 5/5
"Everything ran smoothly, no problems. Excellent."
Delivered on time to the fitting shop at a good price.
Garage really helpful and top people. Great service allround 👍
Efficient. Good customer service. Very pleased with the technical result.
Like the service
I paid for my tyres and booked an appointment for next day to have them fitted. A few hours later I got a email to say my appointment had been rescheduled for a week later. I couldn’t wait a week so I asked for a refund and purchased my tyres next day from elsewhere at a cheaper price.
"I have purchased several tyres now from [REDACTED] and find the whole experience so easy and straightforward.Choosing tyres on the website is great as you can all the relevant information as it is easily laid out and provides technical details such as noise levels, which is important, depending on one's budget - simplicity itself!"
Great customer service very happy good mechanical work 👍😃
Don't bother booking online. None of the garages update availability and [REDACTED] don't really care.
"Its nice to be able to buy tyres online that are not normally stocked at your local shop and have a massive choice of budget and quality tyres,companies like ats when i enquired about the type of Pirelli i was after said it wasn't available to them,but a search on [REDACTED] showed four different types in that make,i had a choice of day and time i could get them fitted without waiting to long."
All worked fine
"Great service, tyres fitted at my place of work. Would recommend with no reservations"
decent price and took 30minutes to fit two. The service at the bar hill pitstop is good in comparison to for example formula 1 service.
Very pleased with all aspects of purchase and fitting service
Very easy to use. Great value. Never had any issues.
"Good tyres, competitive price. Fitters that are used are always fantastic."
"ABSOLUTELY USELESS[REDACTED] have possibly the worst booking system I’ve ever come across. I selected a local garage on Saturday 23 March at 9am and received confirmation of this appointment. When I arrived at the garage, at the booked date and time, the garage told me my appointment was for 10am the day before. Cut a long story short, the garage told [REDACTED] they were unable to fit me in at 9am on Sat 23 March, but they could do 10am on Fri 22 March. That’s fine, however [REDACTED] neglected to inform me of this and I had to rearrange my entire weekend plans. The garage was able to fit me in on the Sunday morning, however myself, my daughter and my parents had to change our entire weekend plans to accommodate this. Also, my wife bought a tyre through the [REDACTED] website, using the correct reference details and [REDACTED] sent the wrong tyre to the garage. My wife has now had to wait a week for [REDACTED] to issue the correct tyre and the garage to have the availability to fit her in.I would not use or recommend [REDACTED] to anyone. The only reason I gave them one star was because the website would not allow me to complete this review without selecting at least one star."
Very easy & simple to use - everything worked as expected & with no issues whatsoever. Great to be able to choose the most convenient fitter. Will definitely use again.
Brilliant from start too finish especially the price i will always use [REDACTED]
Excellent service and price. First time I have used [REDACTED].. will definitely be using them again.
"Quick service, knowledgeable, friendly staff at a good price"
"Regularly use [REDACTED], never once had a bad experience. So easy and simple and delivers as promised. Excellent service 👍🏻"
Very easy to book and the tyres are very good quality. Garage was exceptional and staff very friendly. Only negative is that a 4 wheel alignment is significantly more expensive at the garage than stated on [REDACTED] website.
Nice and easy to use and a great service
"Quick service, on time and recommended"
Exactly what I needed at the best price. Also top service from the ATS fitting people.
Professional company
Very professional and efficient service
"Very easy to deal with. Good value, will defo use this again Brilliant."
Easily bought & arranged and good service when fitted.
"Great service, better than the last time. The web site has improved and the guy who fitted my tyres at home was A++++++ very quick and professional"
excellent service will use again
"No hassle purchase and installation, delivery and fitting at the date and time agreed.Would definitely recommend and use again."
Order process is easy. Now having lack of communication regarding refund on a returned order
"Great as always, have used you before and you will be first when I need new tyres again. Highly recommended and very easy to use, simply order the tyres fitted or not and head down to the garage you chose...Done!"
All fine and easy. Exactly as I wanted it. If you’re patient enough you can get 10% off when there’s a flash offer.
"I bought two tyres not top grade and used one of [REDACTED] fitters in paisley maconachie in well st Paisley. It all went well the young fitter did a good job no extras . Even took out the scrapes on the rimThe tyres look good , were good value and much cheaper than other suppliers.Very happy with the overall service both the tyres and the fitting."
"I’ve bought dozens of Michelin tyres from Costco (very professional tyre-fitting) but on this occasion I just wanted some mid-range tyres for 20yr old (but 80,000) Volvo V70 T5 that we keep sentimentally along with the other car that my dad owned when he died 5yrs ago. Chose Kumho’s as I’d bought a 2nd hand BMW with these on a few years ago and they seemed OK. Existing Avon (ZV-7’s(?)) only 20% worn / 2 years old, but showing extensive micro-cracking to sidewalls. (Incidentally: Seen this before on Avon’s put on the kids’ cars, so consequently wouldn’t touch these again).Responded to customer satisfaction email from [REDACTED] commenting that jobsheet disclosed that fitters has seriously over-torqued wheelnuts (140Nm vs. 110Nn), suggesting they might want to look at their QC/spec. on this. By the time I got a response, requesting a copy of the jobsheet, it had become clear that one of the fitted tyres was not holding pressure, so advised this additionally, when sending copy jobsheet Invited to return to fitting depot to rectify. Unfortunately, return visit was an absolute object lesson in how NOT to deal with a customer service issue, particularly in a business where the customers need to be assured of the professionalism of the service with which they are being provided, not least because it impacts directly on their safety.So:- (Manager) Don’t moan to me as soon as I arrive that you’ve “been dealing with nothing but problems all day!”. I don’t care. I just want you to do what should have done properly with my car in the first place.- (Fitter) Crack the wheel nuts off with the tyre on the ground, not against the auto gearbox-“Park”. This is car DIY, page 1. Unbelievable!- (Manager) Don’t tell me that “often old cars leak from the rims”, inferring there’s nothing to be done in that case. I drove more than a million miles a bought maybe a hundred tyres before you were even born sonny and know perfectly well that there will often be slight corrosion on the bead seat of even a very new alloy wheel, and this is capable of compromising the integrity of the air seal. Any tyre fitter who knows his salt will inspect the rim, note this, and, as necessary, wire brush or even file this smooth.- (Manager) When faced with my sceptical look about “leaky rims”, don’t then pathetically backtrack and suggest kerbing, or a pothole as the culprit (what, in the 20 miles since fitting?!) The rim was not inspected and properly prepared for fitting and that’s all there is to it. - (Fitter) Tighten the wheenuts down in a star pattern, not a circle. And do the same with each of the nuts. Just because there are 5, you don’t have to forget to torque down the 5th! I watched you! - (Fitter) Having been told the other wheel remains over-torqued to 140Nm where’s the spec is 110, don’t check it with your torque wrench set at 110Nm and then tell me it’s OK - you need to loosen the nuts off first and then do it again properly, to the correct torque! God Almighty!They’ve had their chance, and another, so suffice it to say I will not be darkening their doorstep again. It’s a shame, because their choice of tyres is good and sometimes you just need something respectable, mid-range, not ultra-premium, in a tyre. It would never happen, because their prices for the latter,e.g. Michelin, are higher than Costco, but theoretically I could have been going to [REDACTED] and spending £1200+ on 4 tyres for one of my other cars, not £150 on 2... And would it have been amateur night on that visit also? I’m sorry to say that I think so..."
100% satisfaction. Thank you
"Amazing service, quick response and resolution to minor time slot issue, personal above and beyond customer service! Would highly recommend to anyone!"
"I had a fast puncture and needed a new tyre to match my existing fitted on my drive as I had no spare and no jack. [REDACTED].com were competitively priced for the tyre and the mobile fitting charge was only £5. A self employed local tyre fitter arrived on the scheduled date with my tyre and he was professional and courteous. I usually use Kwik-Fit for Tyres but I'd have no hesitatation in using [REDACTED].com in future and the mobile fitting service saved me time, hassle and petrol."
Good deal no fuss fitting would recommend
Mobile fitter didn't turn up on Saturday. No notification from [REDACTED]. Phoned the fitter directly who said that they haven't received the tyres yet and were expected on Tues. Rescheduled for Weds at 9am. Didn't turn up again. Phoned to chase and then turned up at 3pm.
Will never buy from [REDACTED] again
I find [REDACTED] very easy to buy from. The tyres I needed were sold at a reasonable price. I chose to use a garage to fit them and they were delivered to the garage on time and in perfect condition. I've used [REDACTED] 4 times now and I will use them again next time I need tyres for mine or my wife's cars.
Excellent and friendly service communication perfect all ou have to do is turn up at your chosen fitting station and everything is ready for you with no waiting
Purchased 4 tyres to be fitted (at Lavender Motors in Haywards Heath). Car returned; one tyre with dangerously low air pressure. Asked the garage to top up the tyre and check the other three. They did top up the one tyre but didn't bother to check the others. When I checked the tyres 10 minutes later all four tyres had varying pressures (from 29 to 37.5). I emailed both companies and have not received an apology from either. I will never use Lavender Motors again (they shouldn't be in business) and likely not [REDACTED].com either.
great tyres at low prices and great service
Tyres were ready and fitted with minimum of fuss
Only gripe was being asked to sign the 'acceptance form' at the garage without an opportunity to check the job. So I had to ask to see the tyre fitting was ok (no damage to alloys) before signing off the job. All was fine.
good value does exactly what it said on the tin just the job
Good choice of tyres at a good price and a time to suit
I love using [REDACTED] I get my choice can read reviews - book a time that suits me - pay - drop car in and collect when done - brilliant- thank you all
Excellent price and customer service. Will definitely recommend!
First class in all respects including great price
Prices have become significantly less competitive.
Fantastic service and I will be definitely using again
Hassle free great service thank you
Tyres are excellent. Fitting appointment went as planned in work car park. Good communication. Only disappointed that wheel alignment could not be done by the mobile fitter but was correctly advised by fitter. Will use again next time.
Good prices...ATS euromaster Aylesbury was my chosen garage to fit my tyres and couldn't fault them ...
A very professional and efficient service. Would recommend to all.
"OFTEN REQUIRED TYRES,NOT DISAPPOINTED."
Good price for my tyres. Really easy to book. I'd definitely use them again.
Completely satisfied with cost and fitting of tyres

First class service - from internet purchase to fitting the tyres at theGarage
Ordered and paid on line and was told the address of the local fitting agent. Selected the date and appropriate time. Received confirmation Took my car on the day and the tyres were fitted with no hassle by very polite staff. I recommend the [REDACTED] service.

"Used this site a few times now, never had a problem, great communication and a good price."
"Everything excellent - including price, booking fitting and the fitting service provided by the team ( Just Tyres in Guildford) who fitted the tyres"
Good service. Tyres ordered correctly into local garage for fitting. Everything happened in a timely fashion. No complaints. Would use [REDACTED] to source tyres in future.
This is my second time using [REDACTED].com. This company is serious and prompt and their contracted tyre fitting service was excellent. The Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 tyres are a much better driving experience then michelin primacy 3 fitted on bmw xdrive 530d.
new tyres that's it
Ordered tyre and arranged fitting at a garage 1 mile away 2 days after placing the order with no problems.
Top class service and fitting at Eden tyres
Lots of choice of tyres on the site and I was able to choose the fitter I wanted. Tyres were waiting at the fitters as promised and the time slot I was given was stuck to. Can't fault the service so far. Car is running well with four new tyres.
Good price. Good service
Very good value and quality. Great options for fitting and. Good customer service. All round very good- I’ll use this service every time.
Easy to book time slot and choose the tyres I wanted. Very quick fitting.
"Quick and easy to book on line, vast choice of tyre brands rated to fit your particular car. They offer a value choice which are still really good tyres. When you arrive they are waiting for you. Very pleasant and we'll mannered, efficient and get you on the road asap. Thankyou"
Very simple and straightforward process. Would definitely use again.
"Never had any issues with the tyres, fitting or garages i‚Äôve Used via [REDACTED]- easy and cost effective service."
so easy to order the tyre and choice the garage to have the tyre fitted
"I ordered the wrong tyres, however [REDACTED] arranged for them to be collected and supplied the correct tyres within 2 days, whilst also refunding the difference straight away. Excellent service."
"Good experience, first time I have used [REDACTED], Harborne tyres were very efficient, they contacted me to let me know when they could fit my tyres, overall a very good experience."
"I ordered the tyre I needed on line, booked a specified time at a local garage and I had the tyre fitted. All worked very well, to time, and I would use [REDACTED] again. Good price for the tyre, too, as I did a quick search on-line."
Excellent service from point of order to fitting. No complaints at all. Thank You.
"Seamless, well managed at both ends. I would recommend"
